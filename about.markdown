I'm iendjinn and you've stumbled onto my website, welcome!

**Who am I?**

A human from Sol III, I'm interested in science fiction, tabletop role playing games and "keep fit". I also enjoy good coffee and home made pizza.

**Why does this site exist?**

As a place for me to publish and collate my thoughts and projects that I'd like to share with people.

**Why not just use \<insert popular web platform here>?**

Most blogging and social media platforms are designed to harvest your data to sell you more stuff, or publish and store content in a weird propriety format. 

While writing stuff in markdown and transforming it to HTML is a little clunky, it means that this content is independent of the platform it is hosted on. It also means I can deliver this content free from unnecessary cookies, JavaScript and other cruft that are the hallmarks of many modern websites.

## Tabletop Role Playing Games

I was very fortunate to have been introduced to tabletop role playing games by "based Cullen", a fantastic GM who ran a home brew campaign for our group set in the world of Oceanus. Featuring giant turtle ships, ancient underwater domes filled with magitech, and piracy on the high seas, this campaign got me hooked.

Since then I've continued to run TRPGs for my friends in a variety of settings and systems, some home brew and some official systems. Below you can find links to some of my projects, musings on TRPGs, and reviews of game systems I've run.
