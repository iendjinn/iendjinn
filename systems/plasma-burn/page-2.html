            <h3>Movement (Continued)</h3>
            <p><strong>Prone</strong>: Under certain situations a unit may become prone, this should be indicated with a
                token
                or by
                placing the unit&#39;s model on its side. While prone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A unit may expend half its movement to stand up</li>
                <li>Moving while prone costs 2&quot; of movement for each 1&quot; moved</li>
                <li>Prone units may not charge</li>
            </ul>


            <p><strong>Engaged</strong>: A unit is engaged if it has an enemy unit in base contact with it.</p>
            <p><strong>Charging</strong>: A unit may charge an enemy unit by moving into base contact with it. If it can
                move
                into
                contact with multiple units it may charge more than one enemy unit.</p>
            <p><strong>Climbing</strong>: Instead of moving a unit may climb up or down a piece of terrain shorter than
                its
                movement
                characteristic. If a piece of terrain is narrower than the unit&#39;s base then it may climb up and down
                as
                a
                single
                climb.</p>
            <p><strong>Jumping</strong>: When a unit moves, it may move over a gap less than its height.</p>
            <p>For rules on <strong>falling</strong>, <strong>pushing</strong>, and <strong>difficult terrain</strong>
                see
                advanced
                movement rules.</p>
            <h3 id="ranged-phase">Ranged Phase</h3>
            <p>The player with priority makes ranged attacks with all of their units then the other player does the
                same.
            </p>
            <p>When a unit makes ranged attacks it must obey the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It must target the closest enemy unit within <strong>line of sight</strong>, units that are wholly
                    below
                    the
                    base of the unit may be ignored for determining the closest unit</li>
                <li>A unit cannot make ranged attacks if it is <strong>engaged</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>To make a ranged attack roll a D6 for each attack that the unit&#39;s ranged weapon has. If the value is
                equal or
                greater than the unit&#39;s ranged attribute a hit is scored.</p>
            <p>For each hit scored the target unit must make a save, losing a wound if it fails. If a unit loses all of
                its
                wounds
                it is <strong>killed in action</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Save</strong>: Roll a D6, if the value is equal or greater than the unit&#39;s save it passes. If
                the
                save is
                made as a result of a ranged or melee attack then reduce the unit&#39;s save by the armor piercing (AP)
                value of
                the
                weapon. E.g. Save 3+ becomes 5+ against an AP2 weapon.</p>
            <p><strong>Killed in Action</strong>: When a unit is killed in action remove it from the battlefield.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Line of Sight</strong>: A unit has line of sight to another unit if a line can be drawn between
                the
                two
                units
                without passing through a piece of terrain or other unit (including friendly). </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If line of sight cannot be drawn to the entirety of a target unit is counts as
                    <strong>obscured</strong>
                </li>
                <li>Infantry may ignore other friendly infantry that they are in base contact with when drawing line of
                    sight.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Obscured</strong>: If a target is obscured then reduce the ranged skill of the attacking unit by
                1.
                E.g.
                4+
                becomes 5+.</p>
            <p>For rules on <strong>cover</strong>, <strong>multiple attacks</strong>, and <strong>weapon types</strong>
                see
                advanced ranged rules.</p>
            <h3 id="melee-phase">Melee Phase</h3>
            <p>The player with priority groups units that are in base contact into <strong>melees</strong> such that
                each
                <strong>melee</strong> contains at least one of their units and one enemy unit and the number of pairs
                of
                units
                is
                maximized.
            </p>
            <p>The player with priority then picks <strong>melees</strong> in turn and they are then resolved by the
                following
                steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player totals up the melee attribute for each of their units in the melee and rolls that number
                    of
                    D6
                    (melee attacks)</li>
                <li>The player with the highest value wins the melee, in the event of a draw the winner is the side with
                    the
                    unit
                    with the highest single melee attribute (flip a coin if there is still a tie)</li>
                <li>Each unit on the losing side is <strong>pushed</strong> 1&quot; back from the winning units in the
                    melee
                </li>
                <li>The winning player allocates a number of hits equal to their melee attacks to the losing units</li>
                <li>For each hit allocated against it, losing units must make a save, losing a wound if they fail. If a
                    unit
                    loses
                    all of its wounds it is <strong>killed in action</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For rules on <strong>prone</strong> units in melee see advanced melee rules.</p>
