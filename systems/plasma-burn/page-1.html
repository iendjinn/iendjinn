            <h1>Plasma Burn</h1>
            <p>The Old World is gone, its glory seared away by the terrifying weapons of the ancients.</p>
            <p>Against the bleached sky, tattered banners wave in the atomic winds, carried forth by the soldiers of
                would
                be
                Kings.
            </p>
            <p>It is an age of ambition, of forgotten technology wielded by techno-magical warriors, an age of
                <strong>battle</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="the-noble-houses">The Noble Houses</h2>
            <p>Emerging from the bastions of their underground vaults on the edges of civilization, the ancestors found
                their
                way of
                life undone.</p>
            <p>As the hard years passed those few who remembered the Old World faded, leaving only stories and a handful
                of
                relics
                of a golden age.</p>
            <p>But from these embers of civilization new life blossomed. The ancient construct of feudalism was once
                again
                pressed
                into service by humanity.</p>
            <p>Fiefdoms, enhanced with advanced technology far beyond their crude understanding, wage war for the
                invaluable
                wonders
                left behind by their forebears.</p>
            <p>The scions of newly risen noble houses fight for honour, for survival and for dominion over the Earth.
            </p>
            <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
            <p>Plasma Burn is a 28mm skirmish wargame set in an apocalyptic future in which noble houses vie to control
                the
                remains
                of the technological wonders left behind. To play you&#39;ll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>About 10 six sided dice (D6)</li>
                <li>A set of models to represent each sides units</li>
                <li>A board/floor/table and some terrain to make a battlefield</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="units">Units</h2>
            <p>The models a player controls are referred to as units. Each unit has the following attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Move</strong> (Mv): The maximum distance a unit can move in inches</li>
                <li><strong>Ranged</strong> (R): The value required on a D6 to score a hit with a ranged weapon</li>
                <li><strong>Discipline</strong> (D): The value required on a D6 to pass a discipline test</li>
                <li><strong>Melee</strong> (M): The number of D6 rolled when fighting in a melee</li>
                <li><strong>Wounds</strong> (W): The number of wounds a unit can take before being <strong>killed in
                        action</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Points</strong> (P): The number of points it costs to field this unit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Units also have <strong>wargear</strong> which includes their ranged and melee weapons, armour, and
                equipment.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Most units are <strong>infantry</strong>, however some units are <strong>cavalry</strong>,
                <strong>vehicles</strong>
                or <strong>mechs</strong> which have some additional rules.
            </p>
            <p>Some units are <strong>commanders</strong>, which give them access to command actions.</p>

            <h2 id="game-turn">Game Turn</h2>
            <p>A game is made up of up to 10 turns, with each turn being made up of 5 phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Priority Phase</li>
                <li>Morale Phase</li>
                <li>Movement Phase</li>
                <li>Ranged Phase</li>
                <li>Melee Phase</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="priority-phase">Priority Phase</h3>
            <p>In the priority phase players determine which player has priority for the game turn. The player with
                priority
                will
                generally act first.</p>
            <p>To determine who has priority each player rolls a D6. The player with the higher value has priority.</p>
            <p>In the event of a tie, priority goes to the player who did not have priority last turn (re-roll if
                it&#39;s
                the
                first
                turn).</p>
            <h3 id="morale-phase">Morale Phase</h3>
            <p>When 50% or more of a player&#39;s units have been <strong>killed in action</strong> their army is
                considered
                to
                be
                <strong>wavering</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Every unit in a wavering army must pass a <strong>discipline test</strong> or be removed from the
                battlefield
                (not
                <strong>killed in action</strong>).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Discipline Test</strong>: Roll 1D6, if the value is equal or greater than the unit&#39;s
                discipline
                the
                test
                is passed.</p>
                <h3 id="movement-phase">Movement Phase</h3>
                <p>The player with priority moves all of their units up to their move attribute then the other player does the
                    same.
                </p>
                <p>When a unit moves it must obey the following rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It may not move through other units (including friendly)</li>
                    <li>It may not move over terrain that is taller than it</li>
                    <li>It may not move within 1&quot; of an enemy unit unless that unit is <strong>prone</strong> or
                        <strong>engaged</strong> or the unit is charging the enemy unit
                    </li>
                    <li>It may not move if it is <strong>engaged</strong></li>
                </ul>
