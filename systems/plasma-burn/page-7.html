            <p>Vehicle units have the following additional rules and rules exceptions:</p>
            <p><strong>Priority Target</strong>: This unit can always be targeted for ranged attacks if it is within
                line of

                regardless of whether it is the closest unit.</p>
            <p><strong>Melee</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This unit can move even if it is engaged</li>
                <li>If this unit charges an enemy infantry unit, that unit is pushed 3&quot; away from the vehicle</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Weapons Platform</strong>: A vehicle may fire heavy weapons even if it moved.</p>
            <p><strong>Prone</strong>: A vehicle can never become prone, if it is required to become prone it instead

                wound.
            </p>

                arc

                across its center from left to right.</p>
            <p><strong>Killed in Action</strong>: When a vehicle would be <strong>killed in action</strong>, instead
                roll a
                D6

            <p><strong>Transport</strong>: Vehicles can transport a number of infantry units indicated on their profile
                as
                Transport
                (X), where X is the number of units that they may transport.</p>
            <p>Infantry units may be embarked in a vehicle at the start of a battle or they may embark a vehicle at the
                end
                of
                their
                movement if they are in base contact with an access hatch.</p>
            <p>While a unit is embarked in a vehicle it is removed from the battlefield.</p>
            <p>A unit may disembark a vehicle when the unit would be moved in the movement phase. Place the unit within
                3&quot;
                of
                an access hatch, this uses up the units movement.</p>

            <p>If a unit is embarked on a vehicle when it would be removed from the battlefield it must immediately
                disembark
                before
                the vehicle is removed. Any units that cannot disembark (i.e. be placed within 3&quot; of an access
                hatch)
                are
                <strong>killed in action</strong>.
