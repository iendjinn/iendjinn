            <p>A rich cache of scrap, tech, and data have been located by your house, unfortunately your rivals are here
                as
                well.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Deployment</strong>: Players each roll a D6, the player with the highest value picks a long board
                edge,
                the
                other player gets the other board edge. Players alternate deploying 5 units each until all units are
                deployed.
                Units
                may be deployed anywhere on a player&#39;s side of the board so long as they are at least 15&quot; from
                the
                center
                line of the board.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Place 3 markers equally spaced along the center line of the board. At the
                start
                of
                the
                priority phase, whenever a player has a unit in base contact with an objective and there are no other
                units
                in
                contact with that objective they score D3 points. If the D3 result is 1 then that objective is
                exhausted,
                remove
                it
                from the board.</p>
            <p><strong>Victory Conditions</strong>: The game ends at the end of the turn in which the last objective is
                removed
                from
                the board, or after 10 turns. The player with the highest number of points wins.</p>

            <h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
            <p><strong>Falling</strong>: In some situations a unit may be forcibly moved off a piece of terrain, when
                this
                happens
                it falls:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the distance fallen is <strong>less than</strong> its height, place the unit below where it fell
                </li>
                <li>If the distance fallen is <strong>more than</strong> its height, place the unit
                    <strong>prone</strong>
                    below
                    where it fell
                </li>
                <li>If the distance fallen is <strong>more than double</strong> its height, the unit is <strong>killed
                        in
                        action</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pushing</strong>: In some situations a unit may be pushed, when this happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Move the unit away from the source of the push such that it is out of the path of the source of the
                    push
                </li>
                <li>If this is not possible due to other units or terrain then the unit makes a save, taking a wound if
                    it
                    fails
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Moving through difficult terrain costs 2&quot; of movement for each
                1&quot;
                moved.</p>
            <p><strong>Dangerous Terrain</strong>: A unit that starts its movement phase in dangerous terrain, or moves
                through
                dangerous terrain must make a save, if it fails it loses a wound.</p>

            <h3 id="ranged">Ranged</h3>
            <p><strong>Multiple Attacks</strong>: If a ranged weapon has multiple attacks then the additional attacks
                may be
                allocated to units within 3&quot; of the target unit before rolling to hit.</p>
            <p><strong>Cover</strong>: If the target infantry unit is touching a piece of terrain between it and the
                attacking
                unit
                it improve its save by 1. E.g. 5+ becomes 4+.</p>
            <p><strong>Weapon Types</strong>: Some ranged weapons have a type which grants them special rules or
                exceptions
                to
                the
                normal rules.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blast</strong>: For each hit scored place a blast template centered over the target unit. A
                    hit
                    is
                    scored against every unit (including friendly) wholly or partially under the template</li>
                <li><strong>Template</strong>: Do not roll to hit, instead place the narrow end of the template against
                    the
                    base
                    of
                    the firing unit such that the template is over the base of the target unit. A hit is scored against
                    every
                    unit
                    (including friendly) wholly or partially under the template</li>
                <li><strong>Pinning</strong>: A unit hit by a pinning weapon must make a discipline test, if it fails it
                    becomes
                    <strong>prone</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Fire</strong>: When targeting a unit within 10&quot; double the number of attacks this
                    weapon
                    makes before rolling to hit (These can be distributed in the same way as multiple attacks)</li>
                <li><strong>Heavy</strong>: A unit may not make attacks with this weapon if it moved in the movement
                    phase
                    or is
                    <strong>prone</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pistol</strong>: A unit may make attacks with this weapon even if it is
                    <strong>engaged</strong>,
                    provided it targets a unit in base contact with it
                </li>
                <li><strong>Precision</strong>: A unit using this weapon may target any enemy unit within line of sight,
                    not
                    just
                    the closest</li>
                <li><strong>Indirect</strong>: A unit using this weapon may target any enemy unit, regardless of whether
                    it
                    can
                    draw
                    line of sight (target counts as <strong>obscured</strong> if no line of sight can be drawn)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>
            <p><strong>Prone in Melee</strong>: Prone units in melee halve their melee attribute rounding down.</p>
