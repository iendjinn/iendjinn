        <h1>Plasma Burn</h1>
        <p>The Old World is gone, its glory seared away by the terrifying weapons of the ancients.</p>
        <p>Against the bleached sky, tattered banners wave in the atomic winds, carried forth by the soldiers of would
            be
            Kings.
        </p>
        <p>It is an age of ambition, of forgotten technology wielded by techno-magical warriors, an age of
            <strong>battle</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-noble-houses">The Noble Houses</h2>
        <p>Emerging from the bastions of their underground vaults on the edges of civilization, the ancestors found
            their
            way of
            life undone.</p>
        <p>As the hard years passed those few who remembered the Old World faded, leaving only stories and a handful of
            relics
            of a golden age.</p>
        <p>But from these embers of civilization new life blossomed. The ancient construct of feudalism was once again
            pressed
            into service by humanity.</p>
        <p>Fiefdoms, enhanced with advanced technology far beyond their crude understanding, wage war for the invaluable
            wonders
            left behind by their forebears.</p>
        <p>The scions of newly risen noble houses fight for honour, for survival and for dominion over the Earth.</p>
        <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
        <p>Plasma Burn is a 28mm skirmish wargame set in an apocalyptic future in which noble houses vie to control the
            remains
            of the technological wonders left behind. To play you&#39;ll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About 10 six sided dice (D6)</li>
            <li>A set of models to represent each sides units</li>
            <li>A board/floor/table and some terrain to make a battlefield</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="units">Units</h2>
        <p>The models a player controls are referred to as units. Each unit has the following attributes:</p>
        <p><strong>Move</strong> (Mv): The maximum distance a unit can move in inches
            <strong>Ranged</strong> (R): The value required on a D6 to score a hit with a ranged weapon
            <strong>Discipline</strong> (D): The value required on a D6 to pass a discipline test
            <strong>Melee</strong> (M): The number of D6 rolled when fighting in a melee
            <strong>Wounds</strong> (W): The number of wounds a unit can take before being <strong>killed in
                action</strong>
            <strong>Points</strong> (P): The number of points it costs to field this unit
        </p>
        <p>Units also have <strong>wargear</strong> which includes their ranged and melee weapons, armour, and
            equipment.
        </p>
        <p>Most units are <strong>infantry</strong>, however some units are <strong>cavalry</strong>,
            <strong>vehicles</strong>
            or <strong>mechs</strong> which have some additional rules.
        </p>
        <p>Some units are <strong>commanders</strong>, which give them access to command actions.</p>
        <h2 id="game-turn">Game Turn</h2>
        <p>A game is made up of up to 10 turns, with each turn being made up of 5 phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Priority Phase</li>
            <li>Morale Phase</li>
            <li>Movement Phase</li>
            <li>Ranged Phase</li>
            <li>Melee Phase</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="priority-phase">Priority Phase</h3>
        <p>In the priority phase players determine which player has priority for the game turn. The player with priority
            will
            generally act first.</p>
        <p>To determine who has priority each player rolls a D6. The player with the higher value has priority.</p>
        <p>In the event of a tie, priority goes to the player who did not have priority last turn (re-roll if it&#39;s
            the
            first
            turn).</p>
        <h3 id="morale-phase">Morale Phase</h3>
        <p>When 50% or more of a player&#39;s units have been <strong>killed in action</strong> their army is considered
            to
            be
            <strong>wavering</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Every unit in a wavering army must pass a <strong>discipline test</strong> or be removed from the battlefield
            (not
            <strong>killed in action</strong>).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Discipline Test</strong>: Roll 1D6, if the value is equal or greater than the unit&#39;s discipline
            the
            test
            is passed.</p>
        <h3 id="movement-phase">Movement Phase</h3>
        <p>The player with priority moves all of their units up to their move attribute then the other player does the
            same.
        </p>
        <p>When a unit moves it must obey the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It may not move through other units (including friendly)</li>
            <li>It may not move over terrain that is taller than it</li>
            <li>It may not move within 1&quot; of an enemy unit unless that unit is <strong>prone</strong> or
                <strong>engaged</strong> or the unit is charging the enemy unit
            </li>
            <li>It may not move if it is <strong>engaged</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Prone</strong>: Under certain situations a unit may become prone, this should be indicated with a
            token
            or by
            placing the unit&#39;s model on its side. While prone:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A unit may expend half its movement to stand up</li>
            <li>Moving while prone costs 2&quot; of movement for each 1&quot; moved</li>
            <li>Prone units may not charge</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Engaged</strong>: A unit is engaged if it has an enemy unit in base contact with it.</p>
        <p><strong>Charging</strong>: A unit may charge an enemy unit by moving into base contact with it. If it can
            move
            into
            contact with multiple units it may charge more than one enemy unit.</p>
        <p><strong>Climbing</strong>: Instead of moving a unit may climb up or down a piece of terrain shorter than its
            movement
            characteristic. If a piece of terrain is narrower than the unit&#39;s base then it may climb up and down as
            a
            single
            climb.</p>
        <p><strong>Jumping</strong>: When a unit moves, it may move over a gap less than its height.</p>
        <p>For rules on <strong>falling</strong>, <strong>pushing</strong>, and <strong>difficult terrain</strong> see
            advanced
            movement rules.</p>
        <h3 id="ranged-phase">Ranged Phase</h3>
        <p>The player with priority makes ranged attacks with all of their units then the other player does the same.
        </p>
        <p>When a unit makes ranged attacks it must obey the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It must target the closest enemy unit within <strong>line of sight</strong>, units that are wholly below
                the
                base of the unit may be ignored for determining the closest unit</li>
            <li>A unit cannot make ranged attacks if it is <strong>engaged</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To make a ranged attack roll a D6 for each attack that the unit&#39;s ranged weapon has. If the value is
            equal or
            greater than the unit&#39;s ranged attribute a hit is scored.</p>
        <p>For each hit scored the target unit must make a save, losing a wound if it fails. If a unit loses all of its
            wounds
            it is <strong>killed in action</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Save</strong>: Roll a D6, if the value is equal or greater than the unit&#39;s save it passes. If the
            save is
            made as a result of a ranged or melee attack then reduce the unit&#39;s save by the armor piercing (AP)
            value of
            the
            weapon. E.g. Save 3+ becomes 5+ against an AP2 weapon.</p>
        <p><strong>Killed in Action</strong>: When a unit is killed in action remove it from the battlefield.</p>
        <p><strong>Line of Sight</strong>: A unit has line of sight to another unit if a line can be drawn between the
            two
            units
            without passing through a piece of terrain or other unit (including friendly). </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If line of sight cannot be drawn to the entirety of a target unit is counts as <strong>obscured</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Infantry may ignore other friendly infantry that they are in base contact with when drawing line of
                sight.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Obscured</strong>: If a target is obscured then reduce the ranged skill of the attacking unit by 1.
            E.g.
            4+
            becomes 5+.</p>
        <p>For rules on <strong>cover</strong>, <strong>multiple attacks</strong>, and <strong>weapon types</strong> see
            advanced ranged rules.</p>
        <h3 id="melee-phase">Melee Phase</h3>
        <p>The player with priority groups units that are in base contact into <strong>melees</strong> such that each
            <strong>melee</strong> contains at least one of their units and one enemy unit and the number of pairs of
            units
            is
            maximized.
        </p>
        <p>The player with priority then picks <strong>melees</strong> in turn and they are then resolved by the
            following
            steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player totals up the melee attribute for each of their units in the melee and rolls that number of
                D6
                (melee attacks)</li>
            <li>The player with the highest value wins the melee, in the event of a draw the winner is the side with the
                unit
                with the highest single melee attribute (flip a coin if there is still a tie)</li>
            <li>Each unit on the losing side is <strong>pushed</strong> 1&quot; back from the winning units in the melee
            </li>
            <li>The winning player allocates a number of hits equal to their melee attacks to the losing units</li>
            <li>For each hit allocated against it, losing units must make a save, losing a wound if they fail. If a unit
                loses
                all of its wounds it is <strong>killed in action</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For rules on <strong>prone</strong> units in melee see advanced melee rules.</p>
        <h2 id="playing-a-game">Playing a Game</h2>
        <p>To play a game:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agree a mission with your opponent</li>
            <li>Select your units for the mission</li>
            <li>Deploy units according to mission instructions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The winner of a mission is determined by the mission objective. Some missions may be asymmetric with players
            having
            different objectives.</p>
        <h3 id="selecting-units">Selecting Units</h3>
        <p>An army consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Head of House</li>
            <li>1 Heir</li>
            <li>1 Master of Arms</li>
            <li>Up to 1000 points of other units</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each of your head of house, heir and master of arms choose one of the traits:</p>
        <p><strong>Inspiring</strong>: +1 discipline for all friendly units within 10&quot; and line of sight
            <strong>Intimidating</strong>: This unit gains the <strong>intimidating</strong> rule
            <strong>Gene Forged</strong>: This unit gains +1&quot; to its move attribute and +1 wound
            <strong>Strategist</strong>: This unit gains +2 command points
            <strong>Ferocious</strong>: This unit gains +1 to its melee attribute
            <strong>Brave</strong>: This unit gains +1 to its discipline attribute
            <strong>Duelist</strong>: This unit gains +2 to its melee attribute when in a <strong>melee</strong> with
            only
            one
            enemy unit
            <strong>Marksman</strong>: This unit gains +1 to its ranged attribute
            <strong>Beloved Leader</strong>: If this unit would be <strong>killed in action</strong> you may instead
            remove
            a
            friendly infantry unit within 3&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Then choose a pre-fall technology:</p>
        <p><strong>Clone Vats</strong>: Conscripts cost 10 fewer points
            <strong>Battlefield Simulators</strong>: Household Troopers and Sergeants gain +1 to their melee attribute
            <strong>Ocular Implants</strong>: Household Troopers and Sergeants gain +1 to their ranged attribute
            <strong>Dropship</strong>: Up to 5 infantry units may be deployed via airdrop
            <strong>Artillery</strong>: After both sides have deployed their units make 5 ranged attacks with the blast
            and
            indirect rules with a ranged skill of 5+ from your head of house, heir or master of arms
        </p>
        <p>Then choose 5 artifacts, an artifact may be given to any infantry unit in your army. A unit may only ever
            have
            one
            ranged weapon, one melee weapon, one type of armor and one piece of equipment. An artifact replaces any
            default
            item
            of the same type.</p>

        <p>A rich cache of scrap, tech, and data have been located by your house, unfortunately your rivals are here as
            well.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Deployment</strong>: Players each roll a D6, the player with the highest value picks a long board
            edge,
            the
            other player gets the other board edge. Players alternate deploying 5 units each until all units are
            deployed.
            Units
            may be deployed anywhere on a player&#39;s side of the board so long as they are at least 15&quot; from the
            center
            line of the board.</p>
        <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Place 3 markers equally spaced along the center line of the board. At the start
            of
            the
            priority phase, whenever a player has a unit in base contact with an objective and there are no other units
            in
            contact with that objective they score D3 points. If the D3 result is 1 then that objective is exhausted,
            remove
            it
            from the board.</p>
        <p><strong>Victory Conditions</strong>: The game ends at the end of the turn in which the last objective is
            removed

        <h2 id="advanced-rules">Advanced Rules</h2>
        <h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
        <p><strong>Falling</strong>: In some situations a unit may be forcibly moved off a piece of terrain, when this
            happens
            it falls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the distance fallen is <strong>less than</strong> its height, place the unit below where it fell</li>
            <li>If the distance fallen is <strong>more than</strong> its height, place the unit <strong>prone</strong>
                below
                where it fell</li>
            <li>If the distance fallen is <strong>more than double</strong> its height, the unit is <strong>killed in
                    action</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Pushing</strong>: In some situations a unit may be pushed, when this happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Move the unit away from the source of the push such that it is out of the path of the source of the push
            </li>
            <li>If this is not possible due to other units or terrain then the unit makes a save, taking a wound if it
                fails
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Moving through difficult terrain costs 2&quot; of movement for each
            1&quot;
            moved.</p>
        <p><strong>Dangerous Terrain</strong>: A unit that starts its movement phase in dangerous terrain, or moves
            through
            dangerous terrain must make a save, if it fails it loses a wound.</p>
        <h3 id="ranged">Ranged</h3>
        <p><strong>Multiple Attacks</strong>: If a ranged weapon has multiple attacks then the additional attacks may be
            allocated to units within 3&quot; of the target unit before rolling to hit.</p>
        <p><strong>Cover</strong>: If the target infantry unit is touching a piece of terrain between it and the
            attacking
            unit
            it improve its save by 1. E.g. 5+ becomes 4+.</p>
        <p><strong>Weapon Types</strong>: Some ranged weapons have a type which grants them special rules or exceptions
            to
            the
            normal rules.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blast</strong>: For each hit scored place a blast template centered over the target unit. A hit
                is
                scored against every unit (including friendly) wholly or partially under the template</li>
            <li><strong>Template</strong>: Do not roll to hit, instead place the narrow end of the template against the
                base
                of
                the firing unit such that the template is over the base of the target unit. A hit is scored against
                every
                unit
                (including friendly) wholly or partially under the template</li>
            <li><strong>Pinning</strong>: A unit hit by a pinning weapon must make a discipline test, if it fails it
                becomes
                <strong>prone</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rapid Fire</strong>: When targeting a unit within 10&quot; double the number of attacks this
                weapon
                makes before rolling to hit (These can be distributed in the same way as multiple attacks)</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy</strong>: A unit may not make attacks with this weapon if it moved in the movement phase
                or is
                <strong>prone</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pistol</strong>: A unit may make attacks with this weapon even if it is
                <strong>engaged</strong>,
                provided it targets a unit in base contact with it</li>
            <li><strong>Precision</strong>: A unit using this weapon may target any enemy unit within line of sight, not
                just
                the closest</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect</strong>: A unit using this weapon may target any enemy unit, regardless of whether it
                can
                draw
                line of sight (target counts as <strong>obscured</strong> if no line of sight can be drawn)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>
        <p><strong>Prone in Melee</strong>: Prone units in melee halve their melee attribute rounding down.</p>
        <h3 id="command-actions">Command Actions</h3>
        <p>Units with the <strong>commander</strong> special rule may spend a command point at the start of each phase
            to
            use
            one of the following command actions:</p>
        <p><strong>Seize the Day</strong>: Declare at the start of the priority phase to roll 1 additional D6 when
            determining
            priority (the highest value still wins).</p>
        <p><strong>Rally</strong>: Declare at the start of the morale phase, friendly units within 10&quot; (including
            this
            one)
            do not have to test discipline if their army is <strong>wavering</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>On the Double</strong>: Declare at the start of the movement phase, friendly units within 5&quot;
            (including
            this one) move before other units. If both players declare this action they alternate resolving each
            declaration
            starting with the player who does not priority.</p>
        <p><strong>Take Aim</strong>: Declare at the start of your ranged attacks, friendly units within 5&quot;
            (including
            this
            one) may target any enemy units in line of sight instead of just the closest. They do not have to target the
            same
            unit, though all targets must be declared before rolling to hit.</p>
        <p><strong>Cut them Down</strong>: Declare at the start of the melee phase after <strong>melees</strong> have
            been
            decided. The melee this unit is in is resolved first. If this unit wins its melee then it, and any friendly
            units,
            in the melee may immediately move as if it was the movement phase (including charging - player with priority
            redistributes units between <strong>melees</strong>). If both players declare this action they alternate
            resolving
            each declaration starting with the player who does not priority.</p>
        <h3 id="instant-death">Instant Death</h3>
        <p>If a unit takes a hit from a weapon that results in its save being reduced below a 6+ then it is
            <strong>killed
                in
                action</strong> regardless of the number of wounds it has remaining.</p>
        <h3 id="intimidating">Intimidating</h3>
        <p>If a unit wishes to charge an intimidating unit then it must make a discipline test, if it fails it may not
            move
            this
            turn. Units with this rule are not affected by other units with the same rule.</p>
        <h3 id="cavalry">Cavalry</h3>
        <p>Cavalry units have the following additional rules and rules exceptions:</p>
        <p><strong>Prone</strong>: When a cavalry unit is required to become prone it must make a save, if it fails it
            loses
            a
            wound.</p>
        <p><strong>Climbing</strong>: Cavalry units may not climb (though they may still move over terrain smaller than
            them
            when they move).</p>
        <p><strong>Charging</strong>: An infantry unit charged by a cavalry unit must immediately make a discipline
            test, if
            it
            fails it becomes prone.</p>
        <h3 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h3>
        <p>Vehicle units have the following additional rules and rules exceptions:</p>
        <p><strong>Priority Target</strong>: This unit can always be targeted for ranged attacks if it is within line of
            sight
            regardless of whether it is the closest unit.</p>
        <p><strong>Melee</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This unit can move even if it is engaged</li>
            <li>If this unit charges an enemy infantry unit, that unit is pushed 3&quot; away from the vehicle</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Weapons Platform</strong>: A vehicle may fire heavy weapons even if it moved.</p>
        <p><strong>Prone</strong>: A vehicle can never become prone, if it is required to become prone it instead takes
            a
            wound.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Climbing</strong>: Vehicle units may not climb and may not move over terrain above 0.5&quot; high.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Line of Sight</strong>: A vehicle may only draw line of sight from a forward facing 180 degree arc
            drawn
            across its center from left to right.</p>
        <p><strong>Killed in Action</strong>: When a vehicle would be <strong>killed in action</strong>, instead roll a
            D6
            and

        <p><strong>Transport</strong>: Vehicles can transport a number of infantry units indicated on their profile as
            Transport
            (X), where X is the number of units that they may transport.</p>
        <p>Infantry units may be embarked in a vehicle at the start of a battle or they may embark a vehicle at the end
            of
            their
            movement if they are in base contact with an access hatch.</p>
        <p>While a unit is embarked in a vehicle it is removed from the battlefield.</p>
        <p>A unit may disembark a vehicle when the unit would be moved in the movement phase. Place the unit within
            3&quot;
            of
            an access hatch, this uses up the units movement.</p>
        <p>If a unit is embarked on a vehicle when it would be removed from the battlefield it must immediately
            disembark
            before
            the vehicle is removed. Any units that cannot disembark (i.e. be placed within 3&quot; of an access hatch)

        <p><strong>Weapons Platform</strong>: A mech may fire heavy weapons even if it moved.</p>
        <h3 id="airdrop">Airdrop</h3>
        <p>Certain conditions will allow a player to deploy a number of their infantry units via airdrop. Units deployed
            via
            airdrop are <strong>not</strong> placed on the battlefield at the start of the game, instead they use the
            following
            rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From the second turn onward at the start of the movement phase, but before anyone has moved their units
                place

            <li>If both players are airdropping units then the player with priority places their units first</li>
            <li>For each unit airdropped roll a D6 and move the unit the number of inches shown in the direction the 1
                is
                facing
                (I.e. do not move the unit if a 1 or 6 are rolled)</li>
            <li>If the unit lands off the board then it may be placed in contact with the board edge at that location at
                the
                start of your next movement phase</li>
            <li>If the unit lands on top of another unit (including friendly) or impassable terrain it is <strong>killed

            <li>A unit may move as normal after arriving via airdrop, a unit does not count as moving after arriving via
