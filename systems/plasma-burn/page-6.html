            <h1>Advanced Rules (Continued)</h1>
            <h3 id="command-actions">Command Actions</h3>
            <p>Units with the <strong>commander</strong> special rule may spend a command point at the start of each
                phase
                to
                use
                one of the following command actions:</p>
            <p><strong>Seize the Day</strong>: Declare at the start of the priority phase to roll 1 additional D6 when
                determining
                priority (the highest value still wins).</p>
            <p><strong>Rally</strong>: Declare at the start of the morale phase, friendly units within 10&quot;
                (including
                this
                one)
                do not have to test discipline if their army is <strong>wavering</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>On the Double</strong>: Declare at the start of the movement phase, friendly units within 5&quot;
                (including
                this one) move before other units. If both players declare this action they alternate resolving each
                declaration
                starting with the player who does not priority.</p>
            <p><strong>Take Aim</strong>: Declare at the start of your ranged attacks, friendly units within 5&quot;
                (including
                this
                one) may target any enemy units in line of sight instead of just the closest. They do not have to target
                the
                same
                unit, though all targets must be declared before rolling to hit.</p>
            <p><strong>Cut them Down</strong>: Declare at the start of the melee phase after <strong>melees</strong>
                have
                been
                decided. The melee this unit is in is resolved first. If this unit wins its melee then it, and any
                friendly
                units,
                in the melee may immediately move as if it was the movement phase (including charging - player with
                priority
                redistributes units between <strong>melees</strong>). If both players declare this action they alternate
                resolving
                each declaration starting with the player who does not priority.</p>
            <h3 id="instant-death">Instant Death</h3>
            <p>If a unit takes a hit from a weapon that results in its save being reduced below a 6+ then it is
                <strong>killed
                    in
                    action</strong> regardless of the number of wounds it has remaining.
            </p>
            <h3 id="intimidating">Intimidating</h3>
            <p>If a unit wishes to charge an intimidating unit then it must make a discipline test, if it fails it may
                not
                move
                this
                turn. Units with this rule are not affected by other units with the same rule.</p>
            <h3 id="cavalry">Cavalry</h3>
            <p>Cavalry units have the following additional rules and rules exceptions:</p>
            <p><strong>Prone</strong>: When a cavalry unit is required to become prone it must make a save, if it fails
                it
                loses
                a
                wound.</p>
            <p><strong>Climbing</strong>: Cavalry units may not climb (though they may still move over terrain smaller
                than
                them
                when they move).</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Charging</strong>: An infantry unit charged by a cavalry unit must immediately make a discipline
                test, if
                it
                fails it becomes prone.</p>
     
            <h3 id="mechs">Mechs</h3>
            <p>Mech units are <strong>intimidating</strong> and have the following additional rules and rules
                exceptions:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Priority Target</strong>: This unit can always be targeted for ranged attacks if it is within
                line of
                sight
                regardless of whether it is the closest unit.</p>
            <p><strong>Melee</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This unit can move even if it is engaged (unless engaged by another mech)</li>
                <li>Any unit that loses in melee to a mech becomes prone after being pushed back</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Weapons Platform</strong>: A mech may fire heavy weapons even if it moved.</p>
            <h3 id="airdrop">Airdrop</h3>
            <p>Certain conditions will allow a player to deploy a number of their infantry units via airdrop. Units
                deployed
                via
                airdrop are <strong>not</strong> placed on the battlefield at the start of the game, instead they use
                the
                following
                rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>From the second turn onward at the start of the movement phase, but before anyone has moved their
                    units
                    place
                    any number of airdropped units on the table</li>
                <li>If both players are airdropping units then the player with priority places their units first</li>
                <li>For each unit airdropped roll a D6 and move the unit the number of inches shown in the direction the
                    1
                    is
                    facing
                    (I.e. do not move the unit if a 1 or 6 are rolled)</li>
                <li>If the unit lands off the board then it may be placed in contact with the board edge at that
                    location at
                    the
                    start of your next movement phase</li>
                <li>If the unit lands on top of another unit (including friendly) or impassable terrain it is
                    <strong>killed
                        in
                        action</strong>
                </li>
                <li>A unit may move as normal after arriving via airdrop, a unit does not count as moving after arriving
                    via
                    airdrop
                    unless it does so</li>
            </ul>
