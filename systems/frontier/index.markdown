## Introduction
Frontier is a skirmish war game set in the distant future: Humanity has expanded across the stars, founding a sprawling and disparate set of colonies and star empires. At the edge of inhabited space, life is at its most desperate, but also where humanity has its most potential. Factions vie to locate and control valuable new real estate; fighting for their claim on habitable planets, resource rich moons, and asteroids.

In Frontier, you take on the role of these factions and seek to assert control over the future of humanity.

Frontier is designed for two players, and is intended to be played with 28mm models on a 30" x 44" board. Prior to playing a game, both players should agree on a mission, and then decide which units they would like to field for that mission.

Within a mission one player is the attacker, while the other is the defender. The attacker has an objective which they must achieve while keeping their loses to a minimum. The defender must deny the attacker this objective, while inflicting as many loses on them as possible.

## Setup

1. Pick a mission
2. Setup the board with terrain
3. Roll to decide attacker and defender
4. Choose faction and units to field

## Turn Sequence

1. Active player may make one strategic action
2. Active player chooses a unit and action
3. Reactive player may choose a reaction
4. Action roll
5. Resolve action
6. Reactive player becomes active player

## Actions and Reactions

| Action                  | Reactions                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Advance (Mobility)      | Overwatch (Firepower) or Flank (Mobility)          |
| Open Fire (Firepower)   | Firefight (Firepower) or Take Cover (Discipline)   |
| Fight Through (Assault) | Counter Attack (Assault) or Fall Back (Discipline) |
| Bug Out (Discipline)    | Overwatch (Firepower) or Counter Attack (Assault)  |

## Ending the Game

The game ends when:

- At the start of step 2 of the turn sequence, the active player has no units on the board.
- At any point if the attacker has achieved their objective and at least 50% of the maximum points for the mission of the attacking force has been destroyed.

Consult the following table to determine the victor of the battle:

| Attacker Achieved Objective | At least 50% of points of attacking force destroyed | Attacker Outcome | Defender Outcome |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Yes                         | Yes                                                 | Pyrrhic Victory  | Narrow Defeat    |
| Yes                         | No                                                  | Decisive Victory | Crushing Defeat  |
| No                          | Yes                                                 | Crushing Defeat  | Decisive Victory |

---
## Action Roll

Each action and reaction has an associated attribute: mobility, firepower, assault or discipline.

When making an action, check the unit's rating for the associated action or reaction and roll the corresponding dice.

The player with the highest result wins and resolves the result of their action or reaction.

The active player wins in the event of a draw.

If there is no chosen reaction, the action automatically succeeds.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Some reactions, special abilities or terrain grant advantage and disadvantage.

If you have advantage roll twice and use the **highest** result.

If you have disadvantage roll twice and use the **lowest** result.

Advantage and disadvantage at the same time cancel out on a one to one basis. I.e. if you have advantage from two sources and disadvantage from one then you still have advantage, but advantage from one source and disadvantage from another would result in a normal roll.

Advantage and disadvantage do not stack. I.e. you never roll more than two dice.

---
## Special Abilities

Units have special abilities, these are defined as either:

- Active: An active ability may be used by a unit once per game
- Passive: The effects and abilities from passive abilities always apply to the unit

---
## Line of Sight

A unit has line of sight to another unit if a line can be drawn between the two units without passing through terrain or another unit of an equal or larger scale than the highest scale of the two units.

- If a unit is on top of terrain then its scale is increased by the scale of that terrain. E.g. a man (scale 1) standing on top of a wall (scale 1) would have an effective scale of 2.
- If a unit is within 5" of a piece of terrain of an equal or larger scale than its effective scale then line of sight may not be drawn to or from the unit through that piece of terrain.

---
## Shaken and Destroying Units

When a unit is shaken place a token next to it. This indicates that is injured, is pinned down, or panicking.

If a unit that is shaken is required to become shaken again, it is instead destroyed and removed from the board.

---
## Movement

When a unit moves it must obey the following rules:

- It may never end its move further than the specified distance from its starting point
- It may not move through other units (Friendly or otherwise)
- It may move over terrain of a lower scale without penalty.
### Climbing

- A unit may climb a piece of terrain of equal or higher scale when it moves.
- Climbing reduces the maximum movement distance by 1" per scale of the terrain climbed.
- A unit may only climb terrain if it can end its move on top of, or off the piece of terrain it is climbing. I.e. it may not stop halfway up.

### Jumping

- A unit may move freely over a gap between terrain equal or lower than its scale in inches.

### Falling

If a unit is moved off a piece of terrain as the result of an opponent's activity (e.g. overwatch reaction or the repulsor field strategic action) then it falls:

- If a unit falls off terrain of an equal or smaller scale then it suffers no penalties.
- If a unit falls off terrain greater than its scale but less than double its scale then it is shaken.
- It a unit falls off terrain of a scale equal or greater than double its scale then it is destroyed.

## Setting up a game

### Deployment

Each mission will specify the areas on a board that the attacker and defender may set up their units in. Additionally all units of the same type must be deployed within 5" of all other units of the same type if they are deployed at the start of the game.

### Evac Zones

Each mission will specify evac zones for the attacker and defender, both players should familiarise themselves with where these are, or otherwise mark them on the board.

### Faction and Unit Selection

Each player should choose a faction they wish to use for a mission, and then select units from that faction up to the point limit for the mission. Players should inform each other which faction they have picked prior to picking units, but they should then keep their unit selection a secret until both players have picked their units.

---
## Terrain

The purpose of terrain is to break up the battlefield, block lines of sight and create interesting tactical decisions.

Like units, terrain has a scale, additionally it may have certain special rules. You should agree with your opponent at the start of the battle on the scale and special rules of any terrain on the battlefield. You may find that terrain rules only apply to part of a single piece of terrain. For example:

- The ground floor of a building might have the Cover terrain rule.

- The second floor might have the Cover special rule and the Firing Position terrain rule.

- The roof of a building might have the Exposed terrain rule.

A board should include a mixture of terrain from scale 0 up to at least scale 3. There should be very few places where line of sight can be drawn from one edge of a board to the opposite edge.

### Terrain Rules

**Rough**
Units in rough terrain gain disadvantage to mobility action ratings.

> Examples: ruined building, shallow river, swamp, sandpit

**Firing Position**
Units in a firing position gain advantage on Firepower ratings.

>Examples: Trench, bunker, upper floor of building with windows

**Exposed**
Units in exposed terrain gain disadvantage on Take-cover reactions.

>Examples: Bridge, rooftop, hill crest, empty street

**Cover**
Units in cover gain advantage on take cover reactions.

>Examples: Foxhole, barricade, building

**Open Sided**
When drawing line of sight to or from a unit in Open Sided terrain, ignore this piece of terrain if the distance covered by line of sight inside the terrain is 2" or less.

>Examples: Side of a building with windows, ruin, woodland

**Hazardous**
Units that are activated while in hazardous terrain become shaken.

>Examples: Minefield, quicksand, chemical spill

**Impassable**
Units may not move through impassable terrain.

>Examples: Deep water, lava

## Missions

### Assault

The attacker launches a major assault on a strategic location, with troops moving forward across a broad front. The attacking forces aim to secure strong points before moving to support the broader attack along the rest of the front.

**Deployment**

- The defender picks a long board edge and deploys all their units within that half of the board.
- The attacker then places all of their models within 10" of opposite board edge.

**Evac Zones**

- The defenders evac zone is their long board edge.
- The attackers evac zones are the remaining 3 board edges.

**Attacker objective**

The attacker places a marker (strong point) anywhere more than 5" from their deployment zone. When the attacker has a unit within 5" of the strong point they can seize the strong point as a strategic action.

Remove the strong point, the defender then places a new strong point exactly 15" from the old strong point.

The attacker must complete the seize action 2 times to complete the mission.

---
### Sabotage

The attacker infiltrates behind enemy lines, looking to destroy ammunition, supplies or critical infrastructure.

**Deployment**

- The defender places a single marker (the target) within 10" of a short board edge. They then place up to 50% of their total points worth of units anywhere in the same area.
- The attacker then places their units either within 10" of the opposite edge. Or within 5" of the centre line of the board and outside the defenders deployment zone.
- The defender then deploys their remaining units within 5" of either long board edge, outside of the attackers deployment zone.

**Evac Zones**

- The attackers evac zone is their short board edge.
- The defenders evac zones are the other three board edges.

**Attacker objective**

When the attacker has a unit within 5" of the target they may place charges as a strategic action. Add a charge counter to the target. Whenever there is at least one charge counter placed the attacker may perform the strategic action detonation. Any unit within 15" of the marker becomes shaken. 

When the defender has a unit within 5" of the target they may perform the strategic action defuse to remove a charge counter.

The attacker must complete the detonation action to complete the mission.

---
### Ambush

The attacker surprises enemy troops as they patrol or move location, aiming to scatter the enemy.

**Deployment**

- The attacker picks two adjacent board edges. They then setup their units anywhere up to 10" from these board edges.
- The defender then sets up their units anywhere within 10" of the attackers deployment zone, and at least 10" from a board edge.

**Evac Zones**

- The attackers evac zone is either of their board edges in their deployment zone.
- The defenders evac zone is the remaining two board edges.

**Attacker objective**

Destroy units with a total points cost of at least 50% of the defenders starting points total.

---
### Escort

The attacker attempts to rescue a prisoner of war, exfiltrate a spy or smuggle critical supplies.

**Deployment**

- The attacker places a marker (the VIP) within 10" of a short board edge. They then place up to 50% of their total points worth of units in the same area.
- The defender chooses a single long board edge and deploys all their forces within 5" and at least 10" from any short board edge.
- The attacker then places their remaining forces within 10" of the opposite board edge to where the VIP is deployed.

**Evac Zones**

- The attackers evac zone is the short board edge farthest from where the VIP was deployed.
- The defender's evac zone is the long board edge on which they deployed.

**Attacker objective**

Whenever the attacker has a unit within 5" of the VIP and there are no enemy units within 10" that have line of sight to the VIP they may perform the strategic action escort. The attacker places the VIP anywhere within 10" of its current location.

The attacker must place the VIP marker in contact with one of their evac zones to win the mission. Once the VIP is in contact with an evac zone, remove it from the board.
