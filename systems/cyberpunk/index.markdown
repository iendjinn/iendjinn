## 2. Inventory

### 2.1 Inventory Slots

Characters have the following slots:

- Main hand (1 slot).  
- Off hand (1 slot, a 2 slot item may be held in both hands).  
- Body (2 slots).  
- Backpack (6 slots).   

Items on your body may be freely swapped to and from hand slots before you take an action in combat.

Most items take 1 slot, however some larger items may take 2.

While a character is carrying more equipment than they have inventory slots strength and dexterity saves will be hard and all attacks they make are **impaired**.

### 2.2 Usage

Consumable items, and those subject to wear and tear have 3 usage points. Each time one of these items is used it loses a usage point. Once all usage points have been used the item is used up, or damaged too much to use.

- Consumables: Food/drugs/medicine etc. Lose a usage point whenever used.  
- Ammo: After combat if a weapon that requires ammunition was used, lose a usage point.  
- Other Items: At the GM's discretion.  

### 2.3 Weapons

When rolling damage with a ranged weapon add your **dexterity**.
When rolling damage with a melee weapon add your **strength**.

**Unarmed** D4 damage.   
**Light** D6 damage (Main/off hand). If two light weapons are used roll both dice and keep the best result.   
**Medium** D6/D8 damage (Main/off hand). D8 damage when used in both hands.   
**Heavy** D10 damage (Both hands).   

Certain weapons may have additional effects:

- Armor piercing weapons: Damage is not reduced by armor.  
- Automatic weapons: May be used to make an impaired attack against all visible enemies instead of a regular attack. Immediately deduct a usage point from ammo.  
- Blast weapons: May hit multiple targets, distribute the rolled damage between affected targets.  
- Stun weapons: Any character taking damage must make a **strength** save or miss their next action. 

### 2.5 Armor

Armor reduces damage taken by the number of points the armor provides. A character may wear one type of armor at a time and armor uses body slots while worn.

## 3. Playing the Game

### 3.1 Saves

To make a save roll a **D20** and add the relevant attribute (strength, dexterity, intelligence, or presence) to equal or beat the save difficulty:

- Standard: 12
- Hard: 16

A roll of 20 is a critical success.

A score equal or above the difficulty is a success.

A score below the difficulty is a success with a consequence, e.g. it takes longer, you hurt yourself doing it, equipment is damaged or resources used up.

A roll of a 1 is a critical fail.

Expend a point of luck before making a save to gain +4 to your roll.

### 3.2 Combat

Combat takes place in rounds, with each round representing roughly 10 seconds. In each round each character may make one action:

- Attack.
- Move.
- Use an item or cyberware.
- Retrieve an item from their backpack.
- Something else.

If one side surprises the other then they act first, otherwise player characters make a dexterity save to act before non player characters. Order is preserved between rounds.

**Attacks always hit**, roll damage for the weapon being used, adding **strength** for melee attacks or **dexterity** for ranged weapons. Characters that take damage lose hit points equal to the damage taken, with armor reducing damage.

Attacks may be **impaired** or **enhanced**, e.g. a ranged attack against a target in cover would be impaired.

**Impaired** attacks always roll **D4** for damage.  
**Enhanced** attacks always roll **D12** for damage.

At **0HP** a character is incapacitated and may take no action until stabilised. Stabilising a character takes a turn. An incapacitated character will die after **6 turns** if not stabilized. 

If a character drops **below** 0HP they are **dead**.

### 3.3 Recovery

**Short Rest** Takes 1 turn and restores D4HP.
**Long Rest** Takes 1 watch and food, restores D4HP and all luck.  

### 3.4 Time

- Round: Used in combat, roughly 10 seconds.
- Turn: Used when exploring a small area, roughly 10 minutes. Enough time to explore a room, or for a fight to take place.
- Watch: Used during travel or exploring large areas, there are 3 watches a day: Morning, afternoon and night. A watch is roughly 48 turns.

If a character has not had a long rest for 3 watches they lose 1HP every watch until they take a long rest.
