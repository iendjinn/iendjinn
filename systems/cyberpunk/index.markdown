### 1.4 Credits and the Net

All characters start with an implanted data link called a remote communication device (RCD). RCDs provides biometric identification, stores credit information and provides a data connection to the net. A cyberdeck is required to interface with the deep net.

Roll **D10** x 100 for starting credits.

At any point your character may go into negative credits by taking on debt. Negative credit balances double whenever you take downtime. High levels of debt may lead to random purchase refusal or debt collection visits.

## 2. Inventory

### 2.1 Inventory Slots

Characters have the following slots:

- Main hand (1 slot).  
- Off hand (1 slot, a 2 slot item may be held in both hands).  
- Body (2 slots).  
- Backpack (6 slots).   

Items on your body may be freely swapped to and from hand slots before you take an action in combat.

Most items take 1 slot, however some larger items may take 2.

While a character is carrying more equipment than they have inventory slots strength and dexterity saves will be hard and all attacks they make are **impaired**.

### 2.2 Usage

Consumable items, and those subject to wear and tear have 3 usage points. Each time one of these items is used it loses a usage point. Once all usage points have been used the item is used up, or damaged too much to use.

- Consumables: Food/drugs/medicine etc. Lose a usage point whenever used.  
- Ammo: After combat if a weapon that requires ammunition was used, lose a usage point.  
- Other Items: At the GM's discretion.  

### 2.3 Weapons

When rolling damage with a ranged weapon add your **dexterity**.
When rolling damage with a melee weapon add your **strength**.

**Unarmed** D4 damage.   
**Light** D6 damage (Main/off hand). If two light weapons are used roll both dice and keep the best result.   
**Medium** D6/D8 damage (Main/off hand). D8 damage when used in both hands.   
**Heavy** D10 damage (Both hands).   

Certain weapons may have additional effects:

- Armor piercing weapons: Damage is not reduced by armor.  
- Automatic weapons: May be used to make an impaired attack against all visible enemies instead of a regular attack. Immediately deduct a usage point from ammo.  
- Blast weapons: May hit multiple targets, distribute the rolled damage between affected targets.  
- Stun weapons: Any character taking damage must make a hard **strength** save or miss their next action. Stun weapons never deal more than 3 damage to a single target.

### 2.5 Armor

Armor reduces damage taken by the number of points the armor provides. A character may wear one type of armor at a time and armor uses body slots while worn.

## 3. Playing the Game

### 3.1 Saves

To make a save roll a **D20** and add the relevant attribute (strength, dexterity, intelligence, or presence) to equal or beat the save difficulty:

- Standard: 12
- Hard: 16

A roll of 20 is a critical success.

A score equal or above the difficulty is a success.

A score below the difficulty is a success with a consequence, e.g. it takes longer, you hurt yourself doing it, equipment is damaged or resources used up.

A roll of a 1 is a critical fail.

Expend a point of luck before making a save to gain +4 to your roll.

### 3.2 Combat

Combat takes place in rounds, with each round representing roughly 10 seconds. In each round each character may make one action:

- Attack.
- Move.
- Use an item or cyberware.
- Retrieve an item from their backpack.
- Something else.

If one side surprises the other then they act first, otherwise player characters make a dexterity save to act before non player characters. Order is preserved between rounds.

**Attacks always hit**, roll damage for the weapon being used, adding **strength** for melee attacks or **dexterity** for ranged weapons. Characters that take damage lose hit points equal to the damage taken, with armor reducing damage.

Attacks may be **impaired** or **enhanced**, e.g. a ranged attack against a target in cover would be impaired.

**Impaired** attacks always roll **D4** for damage.  
**Enhanced** attacks always roll **D12** for damage.

At **0HP** a character is incapacitated and may take no action until they receive emergency medical treatment. An incapacitated character will die after **60 minutes** if not treated. 

If a character drops **below** 0HP they are **dead**.

Expend a point of luck before making an attack to gain +4 to your roll.

Expend a point of luck after taking damage to reduce damage taken by 4.

### 3.3 Recovery and Downtime
 
**Rest** Get some sleep - restores all luck.  
**Downtime** Lie low for a week - restores all HP and luck.  

When you take downtime their is a chance that your luck may change based on where you're staying. Role the dice size for the chosen accommodation, on a 1 your max luck decreases by 1 (min 0), on a 6+ your max luck increases by 1.

| Accomodation             | Dice |
| ------------------------ | ---- |
| Slum apartment           | D4   |
| Arcology apartment       | D6   |
| Hills apartment or villa | D10  |

### 3.3 Netrunning

The surface net that most people interact with is a locked down set of walled gardens. It's only by using a cyberdeck that net runners can access the troves of data and private networks of the deep net.

A netrun requires a cyberdeck and D3 hours. Depending on the level of the dive a save may also be required. The deeper the dive and the more well defended the target, the bigger the risk to the net runner.

| Type of Run                  | Save Required | Potential Consequences                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surface level data gathering | No            | None                                                       |
| Deep net research            | Yes           | Detection by data daemons or net sentries or other runners |
| Data fortress                | Yes           | Psychological damage from ICE                              |

Cyberdecks can also be used to prepare malware and viruses in advance for rapid deployment. These programs must be saved to a data cassette and are deployed via a cyberdeck to a nearby system. Once used the program must be rewritten as it's signature will have been saved into an ICE database and a counter measure developed.

Preparing a program takes 1 hour and an intelligence save. A military grade variant can be produced by passing a hard save.

| D12 | Program       | Effect                                                                                   |
