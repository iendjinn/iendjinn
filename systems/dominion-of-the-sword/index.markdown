# Dominion of the Sword
The Old World is gone, its glory seared away by the terrifying weapons of the ancients.

Against the bleached sky, tattered banners wave in the atomic winds, carried forth by the soldiers of would be Kings.

It is an age of ambition, of forgotten science wielded by techno-magical warriors, an age of **adventure**.

## Lords of the Apocalypse

Emerging from the bastions of their underground vaults on the edges of civilization, the ancestors found their way of life undone.

As the hard years passed those few who remembered the Old World faded, leaving only stories and a handful of relics of a golden age.

But from these embers of civilization new life blossomed. The ancient construct of feudalism was once again pressed into service by humanity.

Fiefdoms, enhanced with advanced technology far beyond their crude understanding, wage war for the invaluable wonders left behind by their forebears.

The scions of newly risen noble houses fight for honor, for survival and for dominion over the Earth.

## The New Gods

When the Earth burned, the heavens fared little better. The remains of humanity's satellites orbit among a graveyard of machinery.

Through burnt out radio masts and rusting satellite arrays the gods whisper in the night. Huddled around sacred altars, their followers entreat them to share their blessings.

## The Tombs of Kings

Locked in vaults below the Earth sit troves of treasure beyond the wildest dreams of living humans. Scavengers scour the wasteland, searching for these caches of awesome wealth and power.

But the ancients do not take kindly to their tombs being raided. Deadly traps, relentless automatons and the dead themselves guard the deep places, waiting for the desperate, brave or foolhardy who would steal their relics.

## The North Eastern Steppe

### Cors Town

Ruled by the warlord Steel Jaw and ringed by crumbling concrete walls Cors Town sits atop a small hill. A spring rises on the Northern base of the hill and irrigates a small but productive patch of farmland which provides the town with a modicum of wealth to trade with nearby settlements.

### The Cult of the All Seeing

To the North West of Cors Town an old radio mast sits atop a hill. Around its base a ramshackle settlement has grown up, home to a fervent cult that worship the god KH11. The cult has a strained relationship with Steel Jaw, they pay him a nominal tribute, but often acquire the content of this tribute by raiding traders along route 95, many of whom are heading to or from Cors Town.

### The Heights

Past the ruins of Hibbertsville sits a vast hydroelectric dam. Claimed by the Atomic Aces, a violent and powerful gang, the dam has become home to a small community. Led by Pale June, the Aces are notorious for their loyalty and refusal to allow any none members to enter the Heights. Despite this, the gang is open to trade with outsiders, so long as it takes place at the edge of their territory. 

### Sky View

The next settlement along route 95 from Cors Town, Sky View is a technocracy run by an eccentric trio. Despite their peculiarity and aloofness from the population, the leaders of Sky View have proved competent and this has endeared them to their people. Many of the townsfolk have adopted the powdered wig aesthetic and veneration of technology of their leaders. 

### The Barbarian at the Gates

In recent years a new power has arisen in the North. Joel the Burnt leads an army of road warriors, burning any settlement that refuses to pay tribute and recognise him as King. Cors Town now stands at the edge of Joel's Empire and war seems to be on the horizon.

## 2. Inventory

### 2.1 Inventory Slots

Characters have the following slots:

- Main hand (1 slot)
- Off hand (1 slot, a 2 slot item may be held in both hands)
- Body (2 slots)
- Backpack (6 slots)

Items on your body may be freely swapped to and from hand slots before you take an action in combat.

Most items take 1 slot, however some larger items may take 2.

While a character is carrying more equipment than they have inventory slots strength and dexterity saves will be harder, and all attacks they make are **impaired**.

### 2.2 Usage

Consumable items, and those subject to wear and tear have 3 usage points. Each time one of these items is used it loses a usage point. Once all usage points have been used the item is used up, or damaged too much to use.

- Consumables: Rations/drugs/medicine etc. Lose a usage point whenever used.
- Ammo: After combat if a weapon that requires ammunition was used, lose a usage point.
- Torches: Lose a usage point for every 6 turns of use.
- Flashlights: Lose a usage point every watch of use.
- Other Items: At the GM's discretion.

### 2.3 Barter and Money

No standard coinage exists in the new world. Within a settlement most people trade in favours and the exchange of goods. More serious exchanges take place at trading posts, where goods can be swapped for scrip. This scrip can only be used where it was issued, ensuring that those running the trading post can make a markup.

### 2.4 Weapons

When rolling damage with a ranged weapon add your **dexterity**.
When rolling damage with a melee weapon add your **strength**.

**Unarmed** D4 damage.  
**Light** D6 damage (Main/off hand). If two light weapons are used roll both dice and keep the best result.  
**Medium** D6/D8 damage (Main/off hand). D8 damage when used in both hands.  
**Heavy** D10 damage (Both hands).  

Certain weapons may have additional effects:

- Armour piercing weapons: Damage is not reduced by armour.
- Automatic weapons: May be used to make an impaired attack against all visible enemies instead of a regular attack. Immediately deduct a usage point from ammo.  
- Blast weapons: May hit multiple targets, distribute the rolled damage between affected targets.
- Stun weapons: Any character taking damage must make a **strength** save or miss their next action.

### 2.5 Armour

Armour reduces damage taken by the number of points the armour provides. Armour uses body slots when worn, and only one type of armour bay be worn at a time.

**Scrap Metal and Kevlar** 1 point  
**Body Armour** 2 points  
**Adamantine Cuirass** 3 points  
**Power Armour** 3 points + 2 strength  
**Shield** 1 point (must be carried in a hand to benefit, may be used with other armour)  

## 3. Playing the Game

### 3.1 Saves

To make a save roll a **D20** and add the relevant attribute (strength, dexterity, intelligence, or presence) to equal or beat the test difficulty:

- Easy: 8
- Standard: 12
- Hard: 16

A natural 20 is a critical success and a natural 1 is a fumble.

### 3.2 Grit

Characters gain grit as they level up. A character can spend a point of grit:

- After rolling a save to gain +4 to your roll.
- After taking damage to reduce damage by 4.
- After rolling damage to increase damage by 4.

### 3.3 Combat

Combat takes place in rounds, with each round representing roughly 10 seconds. In each round each character may make one action:

- Attack.
- Move.
- Use an artifact.
- Retrieve an item from their backpack.
- Something else.

At the start of combat If one side surprises the other then they act first, otherwise and in subsequent rounds each PC makes a dexterity save to act before NPCs.

**Attacks always hit**, roll damage for the weapon being used, adding **strength** for melee attacks or **dexterity** for ranged weapons. Characters that take damage lose hit points equal to the damage taken, with armour reducing damage.

Attacks may be **impaired** or **enhanced**, e.g. a ranged attack against a target in cover would be impaired.

**Impaired** attacks always roll **D4** for damage.  
**Enhanced** attacks always roll **D12** for damage.

At **0HP** a character is incapacitated and may take no action until stabilised. Stabilising a character takes a turn. An incapacitated character will die after **6 turns** if not stabilized. 

If a character drops **below** 0HP they are **dead**.

### 3.4 Recovery

**Short Rest** Takes 1 turn and restores 1 grit.  
**Long Rest** Takes 1 watch and rations, restores D4HP and all grit.  
**Full Rest** Takes 1 week and restores all hit points and grit.  

### 3.5 Time

- Round: Used in combat, roughly 10 seconds.
- Turn: Used when exploring a small area, roughly 10 minutes. Enough time to explore a room, or for a fight to take place.
- Watch: Used during travel or exploring large areas, there are 3 watches a day: Morning, afternoon and night. A watch is roughly 48 turns.

If a character has not slept or eaten for 24 hours they lose 1HP.
### 3.6 Travel and Exploration

For convenience the world is divided up into hexes. A watch is enough time to travel across a hex if moving along a road. 

Moving across a hex off road takes two watches. If travelling off road the character navigating must make an intelligence save. Failure results in an additional watch being used to traverse the hex. The difficulty of navigation will depend on weather and familiarity with the hex.

Some hexes may contain hidden features or location, exploring a hex to search for these takes one watch.

A character can spend a watch foraging in a hex that doesn't contain a settlement to gain 1 usage points of rations.

### 3.7 Artifacts

Artifacts are powerful items left behind by the ancients, they can be activated to unleash their powers. When activating an artifact roll **1-3D6**, apply the effect listed for the artifact based on the number of **dice** and/or the **total** rolled.

Any roll of a double results in electrical feedback from the artifact, inflicting **armour piercing damage** on the user. For example a double 4 would inflict **4 points of damage**.

**1. Mirror Helm**
Create *dice* illusions of yourself with 5HP each.

**2. Lightning Stick**
Deal the damage shown on each dice to *dice* targets you can see.

**3. Null Ring**
Prevent activation of artifacts within *total* meters of you for *dice* rounds.

**4. Holtzmann Field**
Gain _total_ additional points of armour against ranged attacks for *dice* rounds.

**5. Restoration Gauntlet**
Restore *total* hit points to a target you are touching.

**6. Disintegration Gauntlet**
Deal *total* damage to a target you are touching.

**7. Rust Ray**
Destroy armour of *dice* targets you can see.

**8. Acceleration Amulet**
Gain *dice* additional actions per round for 2 rounds.

**9. Sun Eater**
Extinguish all light sources within 10 x *total* meters.

**10. Boost Shoes**
Jump or fall up to *total* meters without taking damage.

## 4. Character Advancement

Characters gain experience when they bring treasure back to civilization. All experience is split equally between player characters. 

- Common Items: 100XP
- Scarce Items: 500XP
- Rare Items: 1000XP
- Legendary Items: 2000XP

Characters start at level 1, the amount of experience required to advance to a level is equal to the level x 1000. E.g. level 2 requires 2000 experience points.

When a character's level increases: 

- On even levels characters gain 1 grit (see 3.2).
- On odd levels characters gain D4 to their maximum HP, to a maximum of 20.
- Pick one attribute and increase it by 1 point.

## 5. Retainers and Hirelings

Retainers are close friends and associates of your character and will risk obvious danger and peril while adventuring with you. They receive a half share of any experience from treasure.

Hirelings can be recruited to provide support on an adventure. They can carry equipment and treasure, as well as guard the camp and forage for supplies. However they will not risk danger if they can avoid it while fulfilling these duties. Hirelings expect to receive treasure as compensation for their services.

Hirelings can be hired in settlements by making a presence save. The difficulty of the save will depend on the reputation of the character within the settlement.

## 6. Equipment

The following items can be found in most settlements:
