# Dominion of the Sword
The Old World is gone, its glory seared away by the terrifying weapons of the ancients.

Against the bleached sky, tattered banners wave in the atomic winds, carried forth by the soldiers of would be Kings.

It is an age of ambition, of forgotten science wielded by techno-magical warriors, an age of **battle**.

## The Noble Houses

Emerging from the bastions of their underground vaults on the edges of civilization, the ancestors found their way of life undone.

As the hard years passed those few who remembered the Old World faded, leaving only stories and a handful of relics of a golden age.

But from these embers of civilization new life blossomed. The ancient construct of feudalism was once again pressed into service by humanity.

Fiefdoms, enhanced with advanced technology far beyond their crude understanding, wage war for the invaluable wonders left behind by their forebears.

The scions of newly risen noble houses fight for honor, for survival and for dominion over the Earth.

## The New Gods

When the Earth burned, the heavens fared little better. The remains of humanity's satellites orbit among a graveyard of machinery.

Through burnt out radio masts and rusting satellite arrays the gods whisper in the night. Huddled around sacred altars, their followers entreat them to share their blessings.

## The Tombs of Kings

Locked in vaults below the Earth sit troves of treasure beyond the wildest dreams of living humans. Scavengers scour the wasteland, searching for these caches of awesome wealth and power.

But the ancients do not take kindly to their tombs being raided. Deadly traps, relentless automatons and the dead themselves guard the deep places, waiting for the desperate, brave or foolhardy who would steal their relics.

## 1. Make an Adventurer

### 1.1 Attributes

Characters have 4 attributes:

**Strength** Strike, push, carry, life, drag  
**Dexterity** Dodge, climb, balance, throw, shoot  
**Intelligence** Understand, decipher, calculate, remember  
**Presence** Convince, Intimidate, Resist Fear, Inspire  

For each attribute roll a **D4-1**. After rolling you may swap two of the scores.

### 1.2 Hit Points, Grit, and Coins

Characters start with **10** hit points (**HP**) and **0** grit. Then roll a **D100** for starting coin.

### 1.3 Background, Equipment and Look

| 9   | Cage Fighter      | Neural Lash (light, stun), Stimpack, Shield, Torch                         |
| 10  | Mutant Hunter     | Rifle (heavy), Ammo, Flashlight, Rations                                   |

## 2. Inventory

### 2.1 Inventory Slots

Characters have the following slots:

- Main hand (1 slot)
- Off hand (1 slot, a 2 slot item may be held in both hands)
- Body (2 slots)
- Backpack (6 slots)

Items on your body may be freely swapped to and from hand slots before you take an action in combat.

Most items take 1 slot, however some larger items may take 2.

A character carrying more equipment than they have inventory slots has **disadvantage** on strength and dexterity saves, and all attacks they make are **impaired**.

### 2.2 Usage

Consumable items, and those subject to wear and tear have 3 usage points. Each time one of these items is used it loses a usage point. Once all usage points have been used the item is used up, or damaged too much to use.

- Consumables: Rations/drugs/medicine etc. Lose a usage point whenever used.
- Armour and weapons: Roll a D6 for each item used after combat, on a 1-3 lose a usage point.
- Ammo: After combat if a weapon that requires ammunition was used, lose a usage point.
- Torches: Lose a usage point for every 6 turns of use.
- Other Items: At the GM's discretion.

Items that can be repaired may regain usage points, usually costing 10% of the item's value per point. Repairs are available in most settlements.

### 2.3 Storage

Most settlements will have a storage facility that coins and equipment can be kept in. Retrieving items from storage costs 1% of the value of the stored items.

### 2.4 Weapons

When rolling damage with a ranged weapon add **dexterity**.
When rolling damage with a melee weapon add **strength**.

**Unarmed** D4 damage.  
**Light** D6 damage (Main/off hand). If two light weapons are used roll both dice and keep the best result.  
**Medium** D6/D8 damage (Main/off hand). D8 damage when used in both hands.  
**Heavy** D10 damage (Both hands).  

Certain weapons may have additional effects:

- Armour piercing weapons: Damage is not reduced by armor
- Automatic weapons: May be used to suppress instead of attack. Any visible targets must make a **presence** save or spend their next action taking cover.
- Blast weapons: May hit multiple targets, distribute the rolled damage between affected targets.
- Stun weapons: Any character taking damage must make a **presence** save or miss their next action.

### 2.5 Armour

Armour reduces damage taken by the number of points the armor provides. A character may wear one type of armor at a time.

**Scrap Metal and Kevlar** 1 point  
**Body Armour** 2 points  
**Adamantine Cuirass** 3 points  
**Power Armour** 3 points + 2 strength  
**Shield** 1 point (must be carried in a hand to benefit, stacks with other armor)  

### 2.6 Coin

A character can carry up to 250 coin about their person. Additional coin must be stored in inventory slots, with a maximum of 250 per slot.

## 3. Playing the Game

### 3.1 Saves

To make a save roll a **D20** and add the relevant attribute (strength, dexterity, intelligence, or presence). 

If the value equals or exceeds **12** the save is passed.

A natural 20 is a critical success and a natural 1 is a fumble.

Sometimes a save may be harder or easier:

- If a save is with advantage, roll two **D20s** and use the highest result.
- If a save is with disadvantage, roll two **D20s** and the use the lowest result.

### 3.2 Grit

Characters have a point of grit per **two levels**. A character can spend a point of grit:

- Before making a save to add 4 to their roll.
- Before rolling damage to add 4 to their roll.
- After taking damage to reduce damage by 4.

### 3.3 Combat

Combat takes place in rounds, with each round representing roughly 10 seconds. In each round each character may make one action:

- Attack.
- Move.
- Use an artifact.
- Retrieve an item from their backpack.
- Something else.

If one side surprises the other then they act first, otherwise player characters make a dexterity save to act before non player characters. Order is preserved between rounds.

**Attacks always hit**, roll damage for the weapon being used, adding **strength** for melee attacks or **dexterity** for ranged weapons. Characters that take damage lose hit points equal to the damage taken, with armor reducing damage.

Attacks may be **impaired** or **enhanced**, e.g. a ranged attack against a target in cover would be impaired.

**Impaired** attacks always roll **D4** for damage.
**Enhanced** attacks always roll **D12** for damage.

At **0HP** a character is incapacitated and may take no action until stabilised. Stabilising a character takes a turn. An incapacitated character will die after **6 turns** if not stabilized. 

If a character drops **below** 0HP they are **dead**.

### 3.4 Recovery

**Short Rest** Takes 1 turn and restores 1 grit.
**Long Rest** Takes 1 watch and rations, restores D4HP and all grit.
**Full Rest** Takes 1 week and restores all hit points and grit.

### 3.5 Time

- Round: Used in combat, roughly 10 seconds.
- Turn: Used when exploring a small area, roughly 10 minutes. Enough time to explore a room, or for a fight to take place.
- Watch: Used during travel or exploring large areas, roughly 36 turns or 6 hours.

### 3.6 Travel and Exploration

For convenience the world is divided up into hexes. A watch is enough time to travel across a hex if moving along a road. 

Moving across a hex off road takes two watches, or three in poor weather. If travelling off road the character navigating must make an intelligence save, at disadvantage in poor weather. Failure results in an additional watch being used to traverse the hex.

Some hexes may contain hidden features or location, exploring a hex to search for these takes one watch. If a hex has been explored, intelligence saves to navigate are at advantage.

A character can spend a watch foraging in a hex that doesn't contain a settlement to gain **D4-1** usage points of rations.

### 3.7 Artifacts

Artifacts are powerful items left behind by the ancients, they can be activated to unleash their powers. When activating an artifact roll **1-3D6**, apply the effect listed for the artifact based on the number of **dice** and/or the **total** rolled.

Any roll of a double results in electrical feedback from the artifact, inflicting **armour piercing damage** on the user. For example a double 4 would inflict **4 points of damage**.

**1. Mirror Helm**
Create *dice* illusions of yourself with 5HP each.

**2. Lightning Stick**
Deal the damage shown on each dice to *dice* targets you can see.

**3. Null Ring**
Prevent activation of artifacts within *total* meters of you for *dice* rounds.

**4. Holtzmann Field**
Gain 4 additional points of armor for *dice* rounds.

**5. Restoration Gauntlet**
Restore *total* hit points to a target you are touching.

**6. Disintegration Gauntlet**
Deal *total* damage to a target you are touching.

**7. Rust Ray**
Destroy armour of *dice* targets you can see.

**8. Acceleration Amulet**
Gain *dice* additional actions per round for 2 rounds.

**9. Sun Eater**
Extinguish all light sources within 10 x *total* meters.

**10. Boost Shoes**
Jump or fall up to *total* meters without taking damage.

## 4. Advancement

Characters gain experience when they bring treasure back to civilization. Experience gained equals the value of treasure recovered. All experience is split equally between player characters. 

Characters start at level 1, the amount of experience required to advance to a level is equal to the level x 1000. E.g. level 2 requires 2000 experience points.

When a character's level increases: 

- Their grit (3.2) increases by 1 for every 2 levels. E.g. a level 2 character has 1 point of grit.
- Increase 1 attribute by 1 point.
- Pick one other attribute and roll a D6. If the value exceeds the attribute, increase it by 1 point.
- Roll D6 x level. If the total is greater than hit points, increase hit points by 1.

## 5. Followers and Hirelings

A character can have a number of followers and hirelings equal to their **presence**. Hireling must be paid every week, and do not gain experience. Followers do not have to be paid, and may optionally be given a share of the experience from treasure. 

Hirelings are always neutral, while followers may be loyal, neutral or disloyal:

**Disloyal** If the character could gain from betraying you, make a presence save to avoid betrayal.  
**Neutral** If the character would lose something by remaining loyal to you, make a presence save to avoid desertion.  

Failure to pay hirelings will incur disadvantage on these saves.

Hirelings may be hired in a settlement by making a presence save:

| Hireling          | Wages/Week |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Porter            | 10         |
| Bodyguard         | 20         |

| Labourer          | 10         |

| Household Trooper | 30         |
| Armourer          | 30         |
