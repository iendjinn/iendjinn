                <h2>Hyperspace</h2>
                <p>A web of invisible, unpredictable strands that connect the known universe.</p>
                <p>It is across this web that the diaspora of humanity has spread amongst the stars, risking everything
                    for the
                    hope of a brighter future.</p>
                <p>For like their ancestors voyaging across the oceans of old Earth, the crew of these vessels are never
                    quite
                    certain when, or even if they&#39;ll arrive at their destination.</p>

                <h2>The Core</h2>
                <p>Like an archipelago in the vast black of space, the Core is made up of a handful of systems within a
                    single
                    hyperspace jump of each other. Travel here is relatively predictable and something resembling
                    civilization
                    has taken root, grown and evolved over a millennia of interstellar exploration. </p>
                <p>But with stability and security has come regulation, taxation and bureaucracy. Stifling the dreams of
                    the
                    disenfranchised, the adventurous and criminal who once could have carved themselves a piece of the
                    pie.
                    These downtrodden souls now turn their eyes outwards, past the jump-1 limit, to the tantalising
                    promise of
                    the Rim.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>The Rim</h2>
                <p>The frontier of human expansion.</p>
                <p>A beacon in the black for those looking to strike it lucky. </p>
                <p>A siren song drawing the foolhardy to a cold grave amongst the stars. </p>
                <p>Out here what law there is is made by the corporations, criminal syndicates run the space stations
                    and the
                    poor are just one lucky break from the rich.</p>
                <p>But for every success story there is a derelict drifting amongst the stars, a crew stranded on an
                    airless
                    moon, and a colony wiped out by some alien plague. The Rim promises much, and takes even more...</p>

                    <p><strong>Armour piercing</strong> weapons require 2 armour points per wound ignored.</p>
                    <p>Armour points can be regained by repairing the armour, requiring tools and 1 hour of work per

            <h2>Starships</h2>
            <p>Starships are made up of modules, the maximum number of modules a ship can have fitted is called its
                tonnage.</p>
            <p>A starship must have at least one each of the following modules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Life support</li>
                <li>Reactor</li>
                <li>Bridge</li>
                <li>Engines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each module should be assigned a number from 1 to the ship&#39;s tonnage to determine where in the ship
                it is
                located.</p>
            <p>Ship tonnages are: 20, 12, 10, 8 and 6.</p>
            <p>Based on the modules that a starship has it will have a score for the following three attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manoeuvre</strong>: How effectively the ship can accelerate.</li>
                <li><strong>Counter-measures</strong>: How effectively the ship can shoot down or divert incoming
                    missiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Offense</strong>: How effectively the ship can lock onto and fire missiles at a target.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally starships have a <strong>disrepair</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Starts at 0 for a newly built ship</li>
                <li>Increases by D3 each year unless serviced (tonnage x 20k credits)</li>
                <li>Servicing a ship with disrepair removes up to 3 points of disrepair</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Space Travel</h3>
            <p>Starships are capable of two forms of travel: Hyperspace and real space.</p>
            <p>Starships are not capable of in atmosphere flight. Transport between a starship and the surface of
                planets is usually
                performed by shuttle or space elevator.</p>
            <h4>Hyperspace Travel</h4>
            <p>Starships with a <strong>jump drive</strong> module can enter a hyperlane at a jump point. Hyperlanes
                have a length
                and may be mapped or unmapped.</p>
            <p>Mapped hyperlanes take D12 <strong>months</strong> X hyperlane length to traverse.</p>
            <p>Unmapped Hyperlanes take D12 <strong>years</strong> X hyperlane length to traverse.</p>
            <p>Cryo sleep protects humans from hyperspace distortion syndrome. Gain 1 stress every hour if out of cryo
                in
                hyperspace. Do <strong>not</strong> remove wounds and stress while in cryo sleep.</p>
            <p>If a ship makes a hyperspace jump and there is not an android aboard to perform system maintenance roll a
                D20. If the
                value is equal or under the ship&#39;s current <strong>disrepair</strong> then consult the system fault
                table:</p>

            <h4>Real Space Travel</h4>
            <p>Travelling between stellar bodies that are not orbiting each other takes D3 <strong>weeks</strong>.</p>
            <h4>Fuel</h4>
            <p>Engines and jump drives require fuel.</p>
            <p>The maximum fuel a starship can store is equal to its tonnage.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It costs 1 fuel per in system real space journey</li>
                <li>It costs 1 fuel per round of starship combat</li>
                <li>It costs fuel equal to a hyperlanes length when jumping through hyperspace</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The standard price for fuel is <strong>50kcr</strong>, this includes maintenance overheads and other
                basic supplies
                required for the functioning of a ship (e.g. nutrient paste for the galley auto-chef).</p>
            <h3>Starship combat</h3>
            <p>The distance between ships is abstracted into four ranges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensor range</strong>: Too far for effective weapons lock, combat cannot take place</li>
                <li><strong>Firing range</strong>: Close enough to exchange missiles with a reasonable delay before a
                    missile hits
                    the target</li>
                <li><strong>Visual range</strong>: Far enough apart that ships aren&#39;t at risk of collateral damage
                    when firing
                    upon each other</li>
                <li><strong>Boarding range</strong>: Close enough for the use of boarding pods, too close for safe use
                    of ship to
                    ship weaponry</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ship combat takes place when two vessels are at firing or visual range from each other.</p>
            <p>When starship combat occurs, it falls into one of the two situations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pursuit</strong>: The pursuing ships aims to prevent the other ship from escaping to
                    <strong>sensor
                        range</strong>. If this happens then the ship is considered to have escaped and be safe for the
                    time being.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Joust</strong>: Two ships approach on an intercept course that will allow them to target
                    each other as
                    they pass nearby in space. In a joust both ships close to <strong>firing range</strong>, and
                    progress to
                    <strong>visual range</strong> before passing each other.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ship Round</h4>
            <p>Ship combat takes place over ship rounds, with each round allowing a different number of player actions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firing Range</strong>: 2 actions per player</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Range</strong>: 1 action per player</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In a ship round the following happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The GM describes the situation, setting DR for manoeuvre, counter-measures and offense</li>
                <li>Players must decide what actions they want to take to try and boost their ship&#39;s attributes.
                    Players can
                    also attempt to contact the other vessel and negotiate but this takes an action</li>
                <li>Once all actions have been resolved test the ship&#39;s attributes, adding any bonuses the players
                    managed to
                    gain and then apply the effects in the table</li>
