The incessant crackle of a Geiger counter.

The stale smell of the air as the oxygen grows thin.

The cobwebbing of the observation bay window as the _thing_ inside batters against the glass.

Space is slow death, it's panicked breathing consuming the last of your oxygen, it's alien parasites infesting your crew mates. 

Space is hell.

## Hyperspace

A web of invisible, unpredictable strands that connect the known universe.

It is across this web that the diaspora of humanity has spread amongst the stars, risking everything for the hope of a brighter future.

For like their ancestors voyaging across the oceans of old Earth, the crew of these vessels are never quite certain when, or even if they'll arrive at their destination.

## The Core

Like an archipelago in the vast black of space, the Core is made up of a handful of systems within a single hyperspace jump of each other. Travel here is relatively predictable and something resembling civilization has taken root, grown and evolved over a millennia of interstellar exploration. 

But with stability and security has come regulation, taxation and bureaucracy. Stifling the dreams of the disenfranchised, the adventurous and criminal who once could have carved themselves a piece of the pie. These downtrodden souls now turn their eyes outwards, past the jump-1 limit, to the tantalising promise of the Rim.

## The Rim

The frontier of human expansion.

A beacon in the black for those looking to strike it lucky. 

A siren song drawing the foolhardy to a cold grave amongst the stars. 

Out here what law there is is made by the corporations, criminal syndicates run the space stations and the poor are just one lucky break from the rich.

But for every success story there is a derelict drifting amongst the stars, a crew stranded on an airless moon, and a colony wiped out by some alien plague. The Rim promises much, and takes even more...

## 2. Inventory

### 2.1 Inventory Slots

Characters have the following slots:

- Main hand (1 slot).  
- Off hand (1 slot, a 2 slot item may be held in both hands).  
- Body (2 slots).  
- Backpack (6 slots).   

Items on your body may be freely swapped to and from hand slots before you take an action in combat.

Most items take 1 slot, however some larger items may take 2.

Worn items (such as armour, clothing, boots) do not count towards inventory slots

A character carrying more equipment than they have inventory slots has **disadvantage** on strength and dexterity saves, and all attacks they make are **impaired**.

### 2.2 Usage

Consumable items, and those subject to wear and tear have 3 usage points. Each time one of these items is used it loses a usage point. Once all usage points have been used the item is used up, or damaged too much to use.

- Consumables: Rations/drugs/medicine etc. Lose a usage point whenever used.  
- Ammo: After combat if a weapon that requires ammunition was used, lose a usage point.  
- Oxygen Tanks: Lose a usage point for every 6 turns of use.  
- Other Items: At the GM's discretion.  

### 2.3 Weapons

When rolling damage with a ranged weapon add your **dexterity**.
When rolling damage with a melee weapon add your **strength**.

**Unarmed** D4 damage.   
**Light** D6 damage (Main/off hand). If two light weapons are used roll both dice and keep the best result.   
**Medium** D6/D8 damage (Main/off hand). D8 damage when used in both hands.   
**Heavy** D10 damage (Both hands).   

Certain weapons may have additional effects:

- Armour piercing weapons: Damage is not reduced by armor.  
- Automatic weapons: May be used to make an impaired attack against all visible enemies instead of a regular attack. Immediately deduct a usage point from ammo.  
- Blast weapons: May hit multiple targets, distribute the rolled damage between affected targets.  
- Stun weapons: Any character taking damage must make a **strength** save or miss their next action.  
- EVA: Works in a vacuum.  

### 2.5 Armour

Armour reduces damage taken by the number of points the armor provides. A character may wear one type of armor at a time.

## 3. Playing the Game

### 3.1 Saves

To make a save roll a **D20** and add the relevant attribute (strength, dexterity, intelligence, or presence). 

If the value equals or exceeds **12** the save is passed.

A natural 20 is a critical success. If you roll equal or under your current stress you automatically fail and panic.

Sometimes a save may be harder or easier:

- If a save is with advantage, roll two **D20s** and use the highest result.  
- If a save is with disadvantage, roll two **D20s** and the use the lowest result.  
- If a save has advantage and disadvantage they cancel out.  

If you fail a save, gain a point of stress.

### 3.2 Stress and Panic

**Push yourself** by gaining 1 stress before making a save to gain advantage.

**Panic** occurs on a natural value equal or below your current stress and causes the save to automatically fail. Consult the panic table using the value rolled on the D20.

| D20  | Panic Result                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Adrenaline rush: Advantage on next save **or** next attack is enhanced                                                       |
| 2-4  | Anxiety: Gain 1 extra stress                                                                                                 |
| 5-6  | Hysterics: Everyone around you gains 1 stress                                                                                |
| 7-8  | Shaken: Disadvantage on intelligence and presence saves until a long rest                                                    |
| 9-10 | Tremors: Disadvantage of strength and dexterity saves until a long rest                                                      |
| 11   | Phobia: You gain a phobia based on the cause of your panic. Every time you encounter the cause again in future gain 1 stress |
| 12+  | Heart Attack: You die                                                                                                        |

At the start of a day in which you did not sleep, or did not eat on the previous day, gain 1 stress.

### 3.3 Combat

Combat takes place in rounds, with each round representing roughly 10 seconds. In each round each character may make one action:

- Attack.
- Move.
- Use an artifact.
- Retrieve an item from their backpack.
- Something else.

If one side surprises the other then they act first, otherwise player characters make a dexterity save to act before non player characters. Order is preserved between rounds.

**Attacks always hit**, roll damage for the weapon being used, adding **strength** for melee attacks or **dexterity** for ranged weapons. Characters that take damage lose hit points equal to the damage taken, with armor reducing damage.

Attacks may be **impaired** or **enhanced**, e.g. a ranged attack against a target in cover would be impaired.

**Impaired** attacks always roll **D4** for damage.  
**Enhanced** attacks always roll **D12** for damage.

At **0HP** a character is incapacitated and may take no action until stabilised. Stabilising a character takes a turn. An incapacitated character will die after **6 turns** if not stabilized. 

If a character drops **below** 0HP they are **dead**.

### 3.4 Recovery

**Short Rest** Takes 1 turn and removes 1 stress.  
**Long Rest** Takes 1 watch and rations, restores D4HP and removes D4 stress.  
**Shore Leave** Takes 1 week and restores all hit points and removes all stress.  

### 3.5 Time

- Round: Used in combat, roughly 10 seconds.
- Turn: Used when exploring a small area, roughly 10 minutes. Enough time to explore a room, or for a fight to take place.
- Watch: Used during travel or exploring large areas, roughly 36 turns or 6 hours.

## 4. Character Advancement

Characters gain experience points (XP) when they take shore leave:

- 200XP per stress at the start of shore leave.
- 100XP for  shore leave at a remote outpost, military base or colony (costs 200 credits).
- 500XP for shore leave at a major space station or on a core world (costs 1000 credits).
- 1000XP for shore leave at a clinic, resort or specialist facility (costs 5000 credits).

Characters start at level 1, the amount of experience required to advance to a level is equal to the level x 1000. E.g. level 2 requires 2000 experience points.

When a character's level increases: 

- Pick one attribute and increase it by 1 point, pick one other attribute and roll a D6, if it is greater than the attribute increase it by 1.
- Roll level x D6, if the total is greater than hit points, increase hit points by 1.

## 5. Contractors

A character can hire NPCs to work for them, with the maximum number that can be employed at a time being equal to their **presence**. Contractors expect to be paid, usually on a weekly basis, but may accept a share of any profits instead of salary.

Contractors may be loyal, neutral or disloyal:

**Loyal** The character would risk losing something to benefit you.  
**Neutral** If the character would lose something by remaining loyal to you, make a presence save to avoid desertion.    
**Disloyal** If the character could gain from betraying you, make a presence save to avoid betrayal.   

Failure to pay contractors will incur disadvantage on these saves.
