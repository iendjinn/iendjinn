                <p>For 500 years the empire has expanded, its conquering armies flooding across the land like an
                    inexorable
                    tide. </p>
                <p>Now, the tide has turned.</p>

                <p>The faithful question their fervour.</p>
                <p>Heresy blossoms.</p>
                <p>Such a grand idea as the Empire will not die quietly, in its death throes it lashes out, staining the
                    soil
                    with the
                    blood of its foes and citizens alike.</p>

                <p>Shamans entreat with spirits in smoke filled yurts, the wind whistling across the barren steppe.</p>

            <h2 id="the-imperial-province-of-vassica">The Imperial Province of Vassica</h2>
            <p>At the western edge of the Empire sits the province of Vassica. The forests here are old, and the people
                still fear
                to visit them after <strong>dark.</strong> </p>
            <p>The provincial capital of Linium bustles with trade: The blood red wood of the local Wick trees, and peat
                from the
                bogs are loaded onto ships bound for the rest of the Empire. Fed by imports and the outlying towns of
                Pira
                and Gera.
                The Governor Kyros Anton has increased taxes steadily over the years, leading to discontent amongst the
                merchant
                class.</p>
            <p>The glades around Gera are filled with the sound of industry as the locals fell the Wick trees to meet
                the
                demands of
                the Empire. Smoke rises from chimneys in the densely packed streets and vendors hawk their wares from
                stalls, each
                vying to shout down their competition.</p>
            <p>Once a border fort, a town has slowly grown up around Pira. The original stone wall has long been usurped
                and
                converted into housing, replaced by a much flimsier palisade and ditch. The community of Pira remains
                tight
                knit,
                with many of the original garrison having settled and grown old in the town.</p>
            <p>Now the soldiers have withdrawn from the towns, the Governor ordering them back to Linium. Fear grows,
                fed by
                tales
                told by refugees fleeing their villages. The <strong>night</strong> is coming, and dawn may never break
                again in Vassica.
