                <h2>Hyperspace</h2>
                <p>A web of invisible, unpredictable strands that connect the known universe.</p>
                <p>It is across this web that the diaspora of humanity has spread amongst the stars, risking everything
                    for the
                    hope of a brighter future.</p>
                <p>For like their ancestors voyaging across the oceans of old Earth, the crew of these vessels are never
                    quite
                    certain when, or even if they&#39;ll arrive at their destination.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>The Core</h2>
                <p>Like an archipelago in the vast black of space, the Core is made up of a handful of systems within a
                    single
                    hyperspace jump of each other. Travel here is relatively predictable and something resembling
                    civilization
                    has taken root, grown and evolved over a millennia of interstellar exploration. </p>
                <p>But with stability and security has come regulation, taxation and bureaucracy. Stifling the dreams of
                    the
                    disenfranchised, the adventurous and criminal who once could have carved themselves a piece of the
                    pie.
                    These downtrodden souls now turn their eyes outwards, past the jump-1 limit, to the tantalising
                    promise of
                    the Rim.</p>

                <h2>The Rim</h2>
                <p>The frontier of human expansion.</p>
                <p>A beacon in the black for those looking to strike it lucky. </p>
                <p>A siren song drawing the foolhardy to a cold grave amongst the stars. </p>
                <p>Out here what law there is is made by the corporations, criminal syndicates run the space stations
                    and the
                    poor are just one lucky break from the rich.</p>
                <p>But for every success story there is a derelict drifting amongst the stars, a crew stranded on an
                    airless
                    moon, and a colony wiped out by some alien plague. The Rim promises much, and takes even more...</p>
