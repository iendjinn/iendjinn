As with all digital services spotify has begun to suffer from enshitification. Outside of price hikes this has come in the form of advertising even on premium plans. Now this isn't product advertising for other companies, this is spotify pushing notifications about new podcasts that I have expressed no interest in down my throat. This upset me enough to cancel because:

- I have notifications turned off. I don't want them. **Ever**. Anything that disobeys this rule is banned.
- If you're going to tell me about a podcast, you better make sure it's not one about AI productivity. Thou shalt not make a computer in the image of a man.

### So what am I doing instead?

I was very fortunate to discover I still had all of my old mp3s on an external HDD, so I already had music, I just needed a way to serve it. Enter [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/), a music server supporting subsonic clients that runs on a raspberry pi.

With Navidrome set up I started looking for a way to cache my music on my phone for when it was in airplane mode, which for me is 95% of the time as I trust my witch brick far less than I can throw it. 

>There's probably a whole segway here about phones and privacy. For now I'll stop with saying I can't root my daily driver for _reasons_ and since airplane mode has an actual purpose it's possible that android might respect it in most cases. At any rate, it's sufficient for my threat model.

I solved this particularly problem with the [Symfonium](https://www.symfonium.app/) app, which supports subsonic and allows automatic caching of files. Honestly it's not often I like android apps, but this one is the bee's knees. It does what I want, it's configurable and free from cruft.

### But what about discovery?

One word: [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/).

You probably won't find big names on it, but if they've got a big name you'll hear about them somewhere else anyway. 

Another big plus here is that if you buy music on bandcamp artists will generally get a bigger cut of the profits. On top of that downloading stuff from bandcamp is nice, it comes in a zip file. Which doesn't sound like much but when other sites make you download files individually it really makes a difference (I'm looking at you qobuz, no link 'cus this site falls into the necessary evil category).

### Conclusion 

Another small step to reclaim the digital world from the rent seekers that have cannibalised it. It's not as hard as they want you to think it is.
