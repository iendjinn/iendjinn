In my previous post I'd started a campaign journal for a post apocalyptic setting. The first session went great, the players enjoyed it and then...

The campaign died. 

Like most campaigns that die, the fatal blow was struck by scheduling. Between time zones, work, parenting and everything else it proved impossible to get the same group together to progress the campaign.

While I'm pretty sad to see a system and setting I worked on (and my chance to run a hex crawl) go to waste the silver lining is that due to getting a random selection of 2-4 players we decided to run some cyberpunk one shots, set in the cy_borg setting. This quickly gained momentum thanks to the episodic nature of the sessions which allowed players to drop in and out easily, without affecting the verisimilitude of the world.

This was a super power of our blades in the dark campaign that I'd largely forgotten, and probably the main reason we managed to run that for over 2 years and 2 GMs. Simply being able to say: So long as we've got 2 players we'll run every week at a set time seems to guarantee that sessions just happen.

As a result we're now four sessions in to a campaign which has got me as a GM hooked. I've been wanting to run a cyberpunk campaign for a while and all of the banked inspiration and thinking I've done about it seems to be resurfacing.

I've also become active in the cy_borg discord server, which has a ton of great channels for inspiration and game discussion. Though I feel a little bit like an impostor since I'm not running the official cy_borg system - but hey, cyberpunk is definitely not about conforming.

To conclude, if you're finding that life is getting in the way try and episodic campaign/open table. Give up on the idea that you'll always have the same players each week and just enjoy the variety that different numbers of players gives you.
