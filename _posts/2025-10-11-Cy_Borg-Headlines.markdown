Over the course of my Cy_Borg inspired cyberpunk campaign I made numerous pretend social media posts, headlines, and other bits of world building. I'm posting them here for posterity and in case anyone finds them and is inspired for their own campaign.

Some of these make reference to campaign events, while others relate to Cy_Borg's miserable headlines. I really enjoyed this micro-fiction world building and it definitely seemed to be one of the rare occasions that my player's have engaged with world building outside of actual play.

And now a breaking story from the streets of Bigmoss...
_camera footage from a drone zipping through traffic, ahead a pair of gyrobikes flank a cab, their riders brandishing weapons_
An explosion rocked the 23-21 Arcology early this morning, casualty reports are still to be confirmed, with odds of 4-1 available of a mass casualty event from our sponsor Bet Freedom. Over to our reporter Ayla on the scene.

Thanks Brett, I'm here at 23-21 where just minutes ago and explosion rocked the building before two heavily armed mercs fled the scene. The word on the street is...
_camera pans violently as it is grabbed by a pair of hands before refocusing on an Asian face, with cropped black hair and framed by aviators_
I'll tell you the word on the street motherfuckers. Fu Soma here to put a bounty out, 10k credits to whoever ices these motherfuckers and brings me their heads. Bigmoss kidz for life!

The bulwark of the G0 containment wall rises up in front of you, the automated sentries curiously idle, hanging limp like wilted stranglethorns. A small queue of people slowly shuffles towards a dimly lit doorway.

As you get closer to the entrance a heady scent fills the air, emanating from the stairs that lead down from the doorway. A hooded figure presses a pair of black candles into your hands as they lean in and greet you "welcome home".

The stairs finish in a concrete basement, hot with the press of bodies. The crowd sways and sings along as Swift's final album starts to play. A fellow reveller, clad in a fluorescent jump suit bearing Taylor's face hands you a flask and you take a gulp. The music intensifies, the air seems to shimmer and the evening collapses into a kaleidoscope slide show. 

You awaken on a cigarette burned couch, the last few frames of the night playing over in your mind: Candles on a stone altar, a smooth face, devoid of features save for sunken eye sockets, and a rasping, hissing voice in your ear: "Kergoz loves you".

BREAKING: Popular food vendor Greggs announces a new partnership with United Citadel Security. The CEO of UCS had this to say: "Greggs sells top quality reclaimed biomass and thanks to our new range of DNA detecting sentry turrets they'll be able to cut down on theft from their kiosks across the city." Meanwhile protests have taken place outside several stores, with customers citing the need to submit a DNA sample on entry as an "excessive and intrusive" addition to the shopping experience.

News Flash: The stock market has soared after UCS CEO O.B.P. Gunner announces a series of upcoming bombings against rival Alliansen. Our reporter, Ayla is outside Citadel Tower in South Central with more:
_A drone camera rushes down from the towering heights of Citadel Tower before snapping to a halt as it focuses on a female reporter in an Acid Panda tank top with floating golden locks_
"I'm here in South Central where Mr Gunner made his announcement just seconds ago. With a relatively peaceful first quarter behind us the threat marks the first escalation in the business dispute between Alliansen and UCS for several months. A detailed press release from UCS cites Alliansen's claims that UCS was behind the bombing of one of its trains earlier the week as the reason for the escalation, with Mr Gunner describing the behaviour of Alliansen as 'Anti consumer'".

Through busy streets you follow Lisa, her neon jumpsuit bobbing through the crowd ahead of you. The buildings here bear scars from the incident: Shadows frozen against walls, purple hued moss creeping down concrete facades, echoing sounds from another time. 

Finally you arrive in an old mall, gutted and refitted into some sort of discotheque. The beats of Taylor Swift's first album play, reverberating through long steel piping that has been fitted to the outside of the building to emerge as a distorted, but melodic blurt high above. As you pass over the threshold you are temporarily blinded by the glint from a dozen glittering disco balls, ruby laser light cascading off them in a spray of color.

Lisa pops a pill into her mouth and grinning leans in for a kiss, the pill fizzing as your tongues meet. A rushing noise builds in your ears and you feel energy prickling across your skin, your blood seeming to pulse in time with the music. The night gathers pace, you gulp down a shot of a bright blue liquid, the surface choked with glittering dust. 

Songs, faces, places all begin to blur. The world spins around you - the bass drones, or perhaps it's chanting. Disco lights flicker through the smog from a smoke machine, or perhaps it's candles and incense. 

Then a single clear memory, hard stone pressing into your knees, the smell of ozone and something sweet. You look up into the face of a man with sunken eye sockets, at once repulsive and familiar. He passes a goblet to you, the contents a silver fluid that boils with life. 

You raise the drink to your lips and drain the vessel in one gulp, a chill spreads through your body and your vision flickers. Artifacts distort the world around you into a maze of infinity mirrors in miniature, the face of Taylor Swift gazing back at you across time and space. Something moves behind your eyes, and for a split second you see another looking back at you across the void. Then the world shatters, collapsing into fractal shards.

Awakening in a darkened room you stagger towards the bathroom, your heart hammering in your chest. Your shin crashes into a table as you fumble to the sink. Staring into the cracked mirror you lock eyes with the other looking back at you. A sense of calm fills you as you realise you'll never be alone again: Kergoz loves you, after all.

_Security footage of a fast fashion store, suddenly one of the walls is torn apart by a hail of gun fire and three figures crash through into the store. The video freezes and zooms in on the shotgun carried by one of the trio. An info panel opens up showing a rotating render of the weapon and a voice over begins._ "The ACGS Liberator is the latest in our series of personal defence weapons, whether you're protecting your apartment or blasting a gang hit squad in your local mall, you can count on ACGS." _The video resumes, cropped to focus in on the man wielding the shotgun, he blasts an Uzi wielding thug square in the chest as he runs into the room. The footage fades to black, and the ACGS logo appears._ "The ACGS Liberator, the smart choice in self defence".

Dear valued customer,

We're writing to let you know of a small 300% increase in your water bill from tomorrow. The reason for the increase is that due to our previous board decision to sell several reservoirs there isn't enough clean water to meet demand. This means that if we kept our prices the same Cynergy wouldn't be able to continue to invest in replacing the infrastructure that was sold off.

If you believe you would be unable to pay your water bill please get in touch, our subsidiary Big River Loans have many finance options available to help ensure you can keep paying for your water for the rest of your life.

TheDailyPost@cy.news: Wide spread panic gripped Cy last night following a city wide blackout. Cynergy have issued a statement that the blackouts, while longer lasting than planned, were due to routine maintenance. Meanwhile rumours continue to circulate that the blackout was related to the raid on the 616th Legions temple headquarters in the early hours of this morning.

ChildOfKergoz@cy.public: this is so fucking bullshit. There's no way that disc was a real god, it's just smoke and mirrors guys. 

Advert: The ACGS Liberator - your ticket to hassle free public transport. _still image of a knife wielding assailant being blasted in the chest on the tube by a man wielding a shotgun._

MilBlogger666@cy.conspiracy: This 616 stuff is just a cover. The blackout was due to a top secret Alliansen raid on UCS facilities. I know people who work in this area and they say UCS got hit hard last night. Expect retaliatory drone strikes over the next few days.

Mike_Grit@cy.public: Praise the disc! Praise the disc! Praise the disc!
  -> hod@cy.chef: Fuck off Mike. I lost an entire evening's worth of business due to this shite.

_clip from Cy in the morning, a beaming presenter interviews a man with impossibly white teeth, wearing a grey Tulles&deVerte shirt._
"We're here in the studio with UCS' director of competition, Mark Gray, to discuss the explosive success of UCS' new marketing campaign. I'll be the first to say that the corporate competition scene is one of the most innovative fields, but Mark, wow, how did you come up with this?"
_The guest smiles politely, steepling his fingers as if recalling._
"Well Hal, after Alliansen's drone strike on our key note last year, we knew we had to think outside the box. I was in the office late one night whiteboarding ideas with my team when someone mentioned the fact that security around big events and facilities was bound to be through the roof after the events of the last few weeks."
"Then it hit me, we'd obtained a client information database for Alliansen just the other week, why go to the effort of targeting well protected facilities when we could just take out Alliansen's biggest whales."
_The guest pauses for a sip of water and the presenter jumps in._
"Now that's innovation - but weren't you concerned about hitting consumers who also bought from you?"
"Ah, we had no issue there, it was trivial to run an exclusion activation between our customer data and the Alliansen database. To make sure we only sent bombs to the homes of Alliansen customers. The added beauty of course being that now this is public, people know that buying UCS will protect them from the second phase of this marketing campaign."

Public Announcement: Cynergy is pleased to announce that they have regained control of Adam R3 after the terrorist incident yesterday. We expect to have restored the reactor's output by this time tomorrow, in the meantime power will be redistributed across the city to ensure critical infrastructure remains available to all.

Billy@Laketon.cy: wtf guys the powers out! The only light in the entire building is the ad boards.

News Article: Violence has erupted at the checkpoints between Galgbacken and Laketon today. Our report Ayla Skye is on the scene.
_A female reporter, with slowly shifting holographic skin stands in front of a security checkpoint, a line of security personnel with riot shields is facing off against a large crowd._
I'm here at checkpoint 04 where the brave Galgbacken sec corp have been holding the line after the citizens of Laketon took to the streets to protest against Cynergy's energy rationing policy which they claim has left millions without electricity while the lights, and jacuzzis, remain on in Galgbacken.

Public Announcement: We at Cynergy would once again like to reiterate that energy in Laketon and Galgbacken is being rationed according to our contractual obligations. The citizens in Galgbacken have all signed up to our guaranteed uptime plan, which means that we have to meet their needs above customers on lower rate tariffs. Once again we'd like to thank the people of Cy for their patience during this time of hardship.

Ali@cy.public: I wish those sick sick sick guys had just let the reactor go critical. There's not even power to the hospital here right now while those rich fucks in Galgbacken are still partying.

Billy@Laketon.cy: Those bastards have deployed mechs at the checkpoints! I saw one of those machines open up on the crowd point blank with a machine gun. Fuck. This. Shit. Sick world were right.

Breaking News:
Just minutes ago an unidentified terrorist group stormed the headquarters of Royal West Shipping. The group are live streaming a feed of Sri Alraune, Royal West's CEO, tied to a chair with a countdown. The group have yet to make demands, but the stock markets have taken a hit as rumours of a televised execution circulate. Hot on the heels of UCS' executive action last week, which saw an Alliansen director brutally beheaded in his villa, many are wondering if the UCS/Alliansen competition is about to drag a third party into the conflict.

_A female reporter with faintly glowing purple eyes stands outside a grubby looking tower block, a burnt out car smolders off to the side._ I'm here in Lilypond where citizens have been protesting the arrival of 10,000 displaced homeless following Cynergy's decision to flood a neighbouring district to provide cooling for a new TG Labs data centre. The struggling energy company has seen its shares plummet after the recent city wide blackout and hostage situation with the Adam R3 reactor AI. We asked Cynergy COO Dana Azar for a comment on the situation: "At Cynergy we strive to provide critical infrastructure for our customers, as well as value for our shareholders. That being said we understand the distress that the recent flooding has caused and will be offering a 10% discount on the next energy bill of those affected."

_clip from Cy in the morning, a grinning talk show host with a synthwave mohawk interviews a woman in a red dress, wearing a heavy gold necklace._
"I'm joined today with Elaine du Pont, the people's elected representative on the Cy city security council. Elaine, as I gather you've been proposing some fairly radical reforms in the city in the wake of recent terrorist incidents." _Elaine smiles and adjusts her necklace before responding._
"Indeed Marco, I was elected based on my research into novel models for stability, and since being elected I've had my team looking at how we might keep the people on the street safe. Recently I spoke with an executive over at UCS and we think that by introducing a small levy on those living in areas most affected by crime we could fund a new, citizen focused, security corporation."
_The presenter idly injects a vial of something into his left eye while listening, then responds:_
"But Elaine, that almost sounds like a police force, something we abolished years ago due to their institutional corruption... What'll make this any different?"
"Well with a traditional police force funding comes from taxation, which dissociates the police from those they are protecting, they know they'll get paid so there's little incentive to provide a quality service. By utilising an opt out subscription service we directly link 'police' performance with their funding." _the woman smiles, as if she's just invented the fusion reactor, and the camera cuts to an advert for UltraBlue._

Breaking: Alliansen stocks plummeted this morning after a Cy Security Council raid on their headquarters. Elaine du Pont had this to say: "Unfortunately it has become necessary for radical action to be taken against the rogue corporation Alliansen after we received credible reports that they were smuggling a nuclear weapon into the city. Citizens need not panic though, the brave men and women of the Cy police force are taking bold action to protect the people from predatory business tactics." 
Many sceptics have questioned the legitimacy of the reports, viewing the raid as another example of UCS using Cy Security Council to extend their corporate influence and attack competitors.
