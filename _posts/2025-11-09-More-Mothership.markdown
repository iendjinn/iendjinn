In the interest of **playing more games** I decided to offer to run a session of the Mothership RPG for a few colleagues... and it's turned out to be a success so far. Four sessions in we've run the Haunting of Ypsilon 14 and nearly all of Another Bug Hunt (ABH). 

I've been pretty keen to run ABH for a while as it just seems like classic sci fi fun. So far its not disappointed with plenty of opportunities for the player's to explore and make choices while still keeping them moving towards a conclusion. My main criticism of the module would be the enemies:

>Spoilers ahead!

There are couple of issues with the carcinids that I felt as a GM I had to work around:

- Extremely high armor: This works fine when the players face a single carcinid but as the module progresses the vibe moves from Alien to Aliens and they could be facing a dozen of these at once. While you can zoom in and out I feel like for an introductory module this relies a little too heavily on GM fiat to scale how aggressive/tough the carcs are.
- Size discrepancy: We get some art in the module indicating that these things are **big**, however they are supposed to emerge from an outwardly normal (at least in terms of proportions) human host. To get around this I had them emerge about the size of a dog, and then grow over hours to the size of a cow. This did allow me to do some difficulty scaling by slightly lowering the stats of a freshly birthed carcinid, but is obviously not "as written".

Aside from that though this is great module and my players have had a ton of fun so far. Its got good pacing, there's always something for the players to engage with and the decisions they make have weight to them. The locations are well thought out with different routes to the objective and plenty of varied challenges to overcome. 

As for Mothership itself I'm getting into the groove of running the system now. The  complexity of armor, hit points and wounds are feeling less onerous now I'm familiar with them. I would say that the "simultaneous combat" aspect and failing forward probably need better explanation in the rule book. Having previously run Blades in the Dark I'm comfortable coming up with "yes - but" results for failures, unfortunately this needs to be balanced with the genre demand for harsh consequences.

I'm not a big fan of GM fiat being the difference between:

- "I want to back away firing my pulse rifle at the monster" - **failure** - The monster tears into you: Take 3-30 points of damage

And

- "I want to back away firing my pulse rifle at the monster" - **failure** - You stumble backwards firing, tripping over debris: Roll your damage but if you don't cause a wound you're going to take 3-30 points of damage.

This is again a minor gripe, and probably far less of an issue from a player perspective. I'm definitely prone to over analyzing these things and need to keep in mind that so long as everyone is having fun and the game feels fair it's all gravy baby. 

## Pirates!

In other news my main group's Cy_Borg campaign finally concluded the other week which means we'll be starting a new campaign. I'm sticking with my theme of playing official systems for a while instead of home brewing so we'll be running [Pirate Borg](https://www.limithron.com/pirateborg)!
