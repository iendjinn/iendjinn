This year has been a bit of a mixed bag for physical fitness improvement. Life is always a balance between different goals and I've certainly tipped the scales towards family and career over the past 12 months.

Looking over my training journal I noticed that I have probably spent about 500 minutes practicing hand balancing this year. This is a nice silver lining as I've never really managed to invest enough time into this particular skill to see consistent progress. A few milestones I've managed as as result:

- Consistently transitioning from an l sit to a tuck on the parallettes
- Holding a hand stand straddle on the parallettes for 20 seconds
- Consistent entry into a handstand without kicking up into it

With the above in mind I've decided to focus my training on gymnastics in the new year. I've finally got access to somewhere I can hang rings, though I have to start from an l sit on the floor for pull ups/muscle ups, which has got me really excited to take a similar approach to hand balancing and just accumulate volume over the year and see what the resulting improvements are.

In 2026 I'm hoping to refocus some of my energy on making training a priority but for the next few days I'll be taking an ad hoc approach and trial running a few different sessions I might use as part of my regular routine next year. 

Then it'll be time to **get after it** (again).
